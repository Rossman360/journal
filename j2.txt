-VI.XV-

I had hardly slept, worrying about every possible nearterm outcome between Hannah and I. After sleeping a little, Alyse convinced me we should go to Steve's baby shower, so I picked her up and drove to Coxe Ave.
   We played a game of cornhole with Scott and Leann, ate some sandwiches in the small patch of shade next to the bar and eventually left. I had a great nap, woke up around five, got a quad latte from Odd's and watched the cornhole championships at Brew Pump. I eventually went home, shaved, rearranged my room and had a great night's sleep.

I woke feeling refreshed and secure. I drank a coffee, watched some of Wargames, took a bath, walked to Aldi, Odd's, the Brew Pump. I drank two Trail Passes with Lamont, then Michel and Maria, walked home, set up my iMac and typed up some journal entries with the hope of printing them on the label printer.
