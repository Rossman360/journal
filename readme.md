	-VIII.IXXX.XXIII-

So much rain this morning. I was blissed out every time I woke up, especially to see that it was consistently earlier than I expected. I made coffee, swiped on the dating apps, messaged with the two
girls I had been talking to before bed and just lazed around. I made a second coffee and started watching Eminem videos on youtube, basically his most violent stuff.

	-IX.V-

I still have thoughts about how to improve this journal, but maybe not yet the motivation to implement them. Namely, I want to be able to finish writing about the day before, but on the day after. 

	-IX.XIII-

I've decided to just start one master journal file. Today I slept until 12:30, probably because I was up late designing keyboards. Erica will be returning tomorrow, and I think I am excited about that,
but I can tell life is about to be very different. Fall is coming. I am healing. I have a lot of gigs in October, and I plan to spend less time at the bar. I think I really wanted to find someone to
love while the summer was still around, but now I can accept that that may not be happening, and I am very much remembering how to love myself. My daily phone activities are really starting to take a
long time. I remember when I was writing in my journal three years ago, it was: "I woke, made coffee, played wordle, scrolled on my phone and got to work." Since then, I have added daily and regular
chess puzzles, but I think the amount of content I consume on Instagram has doubled at least. I follow so many more people, and they just post so much more content than before. Even keeping up with
Sadhguru content is a major time commitment. But yes, I made coffee and have casually been bringing things up from the basement.  
  
Lucy is back in town now. I don't know who will reach out to whom first (probably she will to me because me contacting her is usually fruitless,) but it has probably been a month since I've seen 
her and I am very excited to reconnect. Since I haven't said this anywhere else, I will say I don't miss the sexual aspect of our relationship at all, but I'm glad we explored it just a little. I don't
even know *who* I would most like to have sex with these days aside from Lauren Squires, who is much younger than me and soon leaving town. I've been trying to integrate the various things into my room that 
have just been laying around in the basement or storage room since Erica left. I found a place for my records, but also found a very sweet love note from Cait in the process. I thought it would make me feel 
more sad than it even did. It was good to remember the love she felt, even if the sentence-to-sentence transitions felt a little forced. I'd be curious to read some of the things I wrote for her, especially 
the one that made her ask if I was feeling depressed.  
  
I set this journal to be backed up on github, messed with the markdown formatting practices and stole Juan's queen. I think it's nearly time for some more coffee. Then I changed my journal macro so that
it changes into the journal directory and edits the file. That way, I'll already be in the correct location for adding, commiting and pushing to github.

. . .  

I drove to Foundry, ordered a burger and set up my drums. The burger (always something strange there,) came in a bowl. We played a fun set with appearances by Max, Trey and Nex. I drank two-and-a-half
Domingas and then drove to the Brew Pump for a gose. Travis and Brody were both being very weird. Lamont was out front and I found it preferable to hang with him. They stayed open til 11, so I had plenty
of time to savor my beverage. Then, I drove Erica's truck home, brushed my teeth, walked to the Country Club and hung out with Kate, Fiona, Sarah, Kevin and my new PI friend John. I told him I would make
a good detective and even cracked one of his cases re Elliott Moss. Kate was being very friendly. I would have hung out with her as long as possible, but I had to go meet Kathryn, who was hanging out with
Jennifer, who's name I blanked on for a very awkward few moments. Once the bar closed, I walked home, drank two more porters, smoked weed and watched music videos. I'm not sure how this favored pasttime
of mine will work with Erica being back in the house.

	-IX.XIV-

I woke somewhat hungover and didn't do anything for a long time. I was farting up a storm but in a very good mood. I made some iced coffee, cleaned both fridges and took out the trash etc. before walking
to the market for coffee and Ingles for floss, a comb, paper towels, pineapple slices, ramen, grape juice and bologna. I even saw Chuck for the first time in like five years. I walked home, put my groceries
away and wrote in my journal.

. . .

It took me an hour and 10 minutes to get down Brevard Rd to the airport, but Erica's plane had been forced to sit on the tarmac for just as long. I went to the bar at the gas station there and sat with some
people who were also waiting to pick up friends from Charlotte. Apparently the restrooms were closed at the gas station and the terminal alike, so things were getting a little chaotic, not to mention the
amount of traffic. Apparently they were waiting because five airplanes had landed at once, and there are only four terminals. I messaged Bakingpy, curious to whether Keebio  would like to stock Rebound Rev 5.
We drove home, smoked some weed from Belgium and talked about keyboards while I played YouTube videos and farted around on Discord. I went to bed fairly early but kept waking up to drink juice. 
I remember at one of those times that it was 4:00AM.

	-IX.XV-

I had been having vivid dreams about being in an open-air play directed by Will Ferrell, but there was much sabatoge and mystery in the way things unfolded. I slept til 1PM and woke overwhelmed by the amount
of texts on my phone. I went downstairs, made coffee, came back up, opened Wordle on my computer, struggled with it, wrote in my journal and asked Bakingpy what the contract details would be, if any.

. . .

Francis came over and we talked with Erica about the possibility of him moving in. It kinda doesn't seem
 like it's going to work unless he downsizes a lot of stuff and finds ways to not need so much validation
from us. We went to the Brew Pump after that and had a nice time. Francis eventually went home. Erica went
to UJ for a burger, and I met up with Lucy. She bought two IPA six packs and a 12er of Topo Chicos. We rode
drunkenly to her house and stayed up all night drinking and listening to music/jamming along with it.

	-IX.XVI-

I woke and poured a Topo Chico over ice, followed by another. I was supposed to have a date at 2PM in Asheville
but really wanted to back out of it. We lolly gagged around Lucy's house for a while and then drove to mine.
"Do you want me to tuck you in?" she said. I did. In actuality, we hung out with Erica in the back yard while I
drank coffee and they tried to play flutes. I remembered I had most of an Oatmeal Porter, and so shared it with
her. My date backed out, and I eventually walked up to the dispensary with Erica to play a gig with Ryan. I was
not playing very well, to be honest, probably because I was drunk. Fursty didn't seem to be in the most focused
mood either, probably because he's going to be a father any day now. He gave us a ride home and I basically went 
straight to bed. Yes, it was lights out by 7PM, but I kept waking up and drinking juice until about 4AM.

	-IX.XVII-

I'm not sure what I did with my morning, but eventually I drove to a house party in deep Swanannoa where
Dulci, Charlie and I played a couple hours of very fun music. I was the last one there, quietly enjoying
a beer by the fire. The owners finally calmed down from party mode, sat with me and discussed all things
spiritual/Christian. I drove home after that, smoked weed with Erica in the basement and won like five
games of chess on my phone.


	-IX.XVIII-

I was sleeping hard til 11 but very much wanted to talk downtown. It was definitely the coldest morning
in many months. I decided to just leave the house and head straight for Battle Cat, where I drank most
of a shot of espresso. I continued downtown and started to feel awake after I had crossed the bridge.
I sat at my secret spot below Little Bee for a moment, went to the bank, deposited $50 and then made my
way to the Asheville Club (having a quick chat with Mad Mike along the way.) There, I had a Guinness +
espresso and decided to go about my day.

I walked back to the west side and decided to pee at the Country
Club. I couldn't resist drinking half a margarita sour in the sun after that. I made my way toward
the house and passed Erica in the church lot on her way to get her hair cut. I went home, grabbed
my chess board and my weed and then walked to the Brew Pump. I set up the chess board and had a 
couple beers with grant, but never found an opponent. Once the sun started going down, I got chilly,
headed home and basically just shut down. I definitely wasn't able to sleep very easily, but I just
hung out on my phone and not on my phone until at least 2AM. 


	-IX.XIX-

I slept til 11, played Wordle, made coffee, wrote in my journal, got caught up on Discord, made more
coffee and wrote in my journal some more. I did some Hinge swiping, got JLC quotes for Madeline at 50 & 100x, made some Drashna-
requested updates to Palmetto, deleted a bunch of emails, did my chess puzzles, finished my coffee and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I went to the Brew Pump for one People's Porter and then down to Blob rehearsal with Jackson filling in on Tele, which was very fun.
It was cold on the walk home. I made some noodles, won one game of chess in bed and fell asleep at a reasonable hour.

	-IX.XX-

I was worried about Erica. Her basement door was open and I hadn't heard any sign of her by 10AM.
By 11:30 though, I finally heard the shower running. I made some coffee, played Wordle (Snare in six,) scrolled on the dating
apps, looked at  social media and listened to Shabang, or, watched all the videos, technically.

. . .

I mainly relaxed, made some ramen until Kevin reconfirmed that he would be able to give me a ride to Scott McMicken rehearsal,
at which point I walked up to the Pump and had a half porter. We had the best, most surreal hang at Scott's house. I already 
feel like we are friends. The music was great and we definitely bonded over grapes and purple drinks. I was expecting to run
through material from Shabang, but he ended up showing us some rough ideas he was working on, and we had a very natural way of
working together under his thoughtful leadership. Kevin drove me home and I went straight to bed.

	-IX.XXI-

Woke, drank coffee, did all the things and contacted Gary around noon, who was more than happy to pick me up and in the neighborhood.
We had lunch at Botiwalla and then headed to his house and loaded up his trailer. We took a load to his new place, unloaded it,
got some essentials from Ingles and then packed a bit more with Ryan and Melissa around. We ate pizza and took another load to his new
place, after which I went home and straight to bed again.

	-IX.XXII-

I was very tired from moving. I had coffee etc. and decided to tinker around with my Palmetto build. I was going to change out the bottom
row when I realized how truly warped the PCB was. I decided I would make use of the switchplate Travis had sent me, so I desoldered the
whole board and made use of some three-pin Box Browns Erica had in the basement. I still need to order an o-ring and maybe figure out
some gaskets, but, after modifying the keymap a bit and changing to SA Filco Navy, I am having quite a nice time typing on this keyboard.

I was typing about this in the terminal and just figured I would switch to the journal since it is fairly relevant and coherant.
I just added four tiny pieces of foam to the north and south side of the Palmetto PCB, which has created a better typing sound, prevents any keys
from scraping, and keeps the PCB inside the case when turned upside down. It's always amazing what a little dampening can do.

I spent most of the night struggling with SSH PHP and a short in the keyboard. I never could get bluehost to stop complaining
about to many failed login attemps. I finally got PHP working after much fooling. The reason I was trying to do this stuff is that
Lucy called and said she wanted to get next week and have me make her a website in exchange for massage+weed. I should have tried
to tackle the fact that my keyboard was shorting out first, but I thought it was a problem with tap code delay because it was only
happening when I held down spacebar to use my mods. It turns out that's actually when I was just hitting the keyboard the hardest, and so I was
probably pushing the PCB into the bottom of the case. In addition to all this, I deleted my github SSH key, so now I can't even push changes. I was feeling
pretty frantic so I decided to close all my tabs and restart my computer. Oh, I've also been meaning to respond to Alison on Hinge,
who seems pretty into me. Ah man, I'm not even gonna be able to push this journal entry. Which item do I tackle first? Alison!

I fixed SSH for github and even for bluehost. I smoked a bowl with Erica and placed the diodes for Rebound 5, then routed all the rows
and columns.
