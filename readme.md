	-VIII.IXXX.XXIII-

So much rain this morning. I was blissed out every time I woke up, especially to see that it was consistently earlier than I expected. I made coffee, swiped on the dating apps, messaged with the two
girls I had been talking to before bed and just lazed around. I made a second coffee and started watching Eminem videos on youtube, basically his most violent stuff.

I still have thoughts about how to improve this journal, but maybe not yet the motivation to implement them. Namely, I want to be able to finish writing about the day before, but on the day after. 

    -IX.XIII-

I've decided to just start one master journal file. Today I slept until 12:30, probably because I was up late designing keyboards. Erica will be returning tomorrow, and I think I am excited about that, 
but I can tell life is about to be very different. Fall is coming. I am healing. I have a lot of gigs in October, and I plan to spend less time at the bar. I think I really wanted to find someone to
love while the summer was still around, but now I can accept that that may not be happening, and I am very much remembering how to love myself. My daily phone activities are really starting to take a
long time. I remember when I was writing in my journal three years ago, it was: "I woke, made coffee, played wordle, scrolled on my phone and got to work." Since then, I have added daily and regular
chess puzzles, but I think the amount of content I consume on Instagram has doubled at least. I follow so many more people, and they just post so much more content than before. Even keeping up with
Sadhguru content is a major time commitment. But yes, I made coffee and have casually been bringing things up from the basement.
	Lucy is back in town now. I don't know who will reach out to whom first (probably she will to me because me contacting her is usually fruitless,) but it has probably been a month since I've seen 
her and I am very excited to reconnect. Since I haven't said this anywhere else, I will say I don't miss the sexual aspect of our relationship at all, but I'm glad we explored it just a little. I don't
even know *who* I would most like to have sex with these days aside from Lauren Squires, who is much younger than me and soon leaving town. I've been trying to integrate the various things into my room that have just been laying around in the basement or storage room since Erica left. I found a place for my records, but also found a 
very sweet love note from Cait in the process. I thought it would make me feel more sad than it even did. It was good to remember the love she felt, even if the sentence-to-sentence transitions felt a
little forced. I'd be curious to read some of the things I wrote for her, especially the one that made her ask if I was feeling depressed.
