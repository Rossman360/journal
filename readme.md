	-VIII.IXXX.XXIII-

So much rain this morning. I was blissed out every time I woke up, especially to see that it was consistently earlier than I expected. I made coffee, swiped on the dating apps, messaged with the two
girls I had been talking to before bed and just lazed around. I made a second coffee and started watching Eminem videos on youtube, basically his most violent stuff.

I still have thoughts about how to improve this journal, but maybe not yet the motivation to implement them. Namely, I want to be able to finish writing about the day before, but on the day after. 

    -IX.XIII-

I've decided to just start one master journal file. Today I slept until 12:30, probably because I was up late designing keyboards. Erica will be returning tomorrow, and I think I am excited about that,
but I can tell life is about to be very different. Fall is coming. I am healing. I have a lot of gigs in October, and I plan to spend less time at the bar. I think I really wanted to find someone to
love while the summer was still around, but now I can accept that that may not be happening, and I am very much remembering how to love myself. My daily phone activities are really starting to take a
long time. I remember when I was writing in my journal three years ago, it was: "I woke, made coffee, played wordle, scrolled on my phone and got to work." Since then, I have added daily and regular
chess puzzles, but I think the amount of content I consume on Instagram has doubled at least. I follow so many more people, and they just post so much more content than before. Even keeping up with
Sadhguru content is a major time commitment. But yes, I made coffee and have casually been bringing things up from the basement.  
  
Lucy is back in town now. I don't know who will reach out to whom first (probably she will to me because me contacting her is usually fruitless,) but it has probably been a month since I've seen 
her and I am very excited to reconnect. Since I haven't said this anywhere else, I will say I don't miss the sexual aspect of our relationship at all, but I'm glad we explored it just a little. I don't
even know *who* I would most like to have sex with these days aside from Lauren Squires, who is much younger than me and soon leaving town. I've been trying to integrate the various things into my room that 
have just been laying around in the basement or storage room since Erica left. I found a place for my records, but also found a very sweet love note from Cait in the process. I thought it would make me feel 
more sad than it even did. It was good to remember the love she felt, even if the sentence-to-sentence transitions felt a little forced. I'd be curious to read some of the things I wrote for her, especially 
the one that made her ask if I was feeling depressed.  
  
I set this journal to be backed up on github, messed with the markdown formatting practices and stole Juan's queen. I think it's nearly time for some more coffee. Then I changed my journal macro so that
it changes into the journal directory and edits the file. That way, I'll already be in the correct location for adding, commiting and pushing to github.

I drove to Foundry, ordered a burger and set up my drums. The burger (always something strange there,) came in a bowl. We played a fun set with appearances by Max, Trey and Nex. I drank two-and-a-half
Domingas and then drove to the Brew Pump for a gose. Travis and Brody were both being very weird. Lamont was out front and I found it preferable to hang with him. They stayed open til 11, so I had plenty
of time to savor my beverage. Then, I drove Erica's truck home, brushed my teeth, walked to the Country Club and hung out with Kate, Fiona, Sarah, Kevin and my new PI friend John. I told him I would make
a good detective and even cracked one of his cases re Elliott Moss. Kate was being very friendly. I would have hung out with her as long as possible, but I had to go meet Kathryn, who was hanging out with
Jennifer, who's name I blanked on for a very awkward few moments. Once the bar closed, I walked home, drank two more porters, smoked weed and watched music videos. I'm not sure how this favored pasttime
of mine will work with Erica being back in the house.

	-IX.XIV-

I woke somewhat hungover and didn't do anything for a long time. I was farting up a storm but in a very good mood. I made some iced coffee, cleaned both fridges and took out the trash etc. before walking
to the market for coffee and Ingles for floss, a comb, paper towels, pineapple slices, ramen, grape juice and bologna. I even saw Chuck for the first time in like five years. I walked home, put my groceries
away and wrote in my journal.
