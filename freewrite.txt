This is now my freewrite file. It is not a journal. It is simply a place for ideas when they creep in, or if I sense them on the periphery.

A day of doing nothing
It makes me wonder
How much better could life be
If everyone was able to do this
No hangover
No work
Not even going on a walk or buying a coffee
Would we write more poems?
Paint more paintings?

My journal has become so structured, but I remember my place to be free.
A blank text document without distractions, without rules.
I said it out loud two or three times at the Orange Peel show, and I maybe
even put it in my journal; I really want to go on tour. I think I need to.
I long for the staring out the window, beholden to nobody but the band.
And getting there on time.

I was happy to be at home
For a year or two off
I begged for it
And I needed Cait to love
But now I am ready to start at the same point on a different circle
To be single and travel
To make money
To eat at the restaurant that makes the most sense in any given city
At the given time of day
Or have it brought to me

The road is not my mother

. . .

I had a strong feeling that I might need to write something. Do I have a life story yet?
I was born and thought I had a good childhood... just felt insecure about the strangers in my house.
I stopped doing schoolwork because it seemed like pointless bullshit.
I discovered drums/marching band and found my people.
I went to college and started to feel like myself.
We made a band and saw some success over a 10-year period.

My first girlfriend moved to New York.
My second girlfriend moved out because she was suicidal.
My third girlfriend cheated on me with my bandmate and many more.
My band broke up.
My fourth girlfriend became my fiancee, cheated on me and dumped me.
I moved in with my friend and have been focusing on healing while playing music with my favorite musician.


For some reason, I am dealing with extra Cait anger. I think I am just sad because it is dreary and cold, but she is a good scapegoat for my angst.
I am also broke and somewhat bored, and definitely not motivated. I wondered on the way too and from Ingles how she could still be living with herself.
I would really like if she reached out to me. I'm not sure I would be nice. Interestingly, I forgot all about her while I was shopping for groceries.
Tomorrow I have Blob rehearsal. Thursday I have TAHP reharsal at an unknown time. I also told Aren I would meet up with him, but I may not have any
money by then. Friday, Fwuit is playing the Mt. Mitchell golf club again. I should have money that day. Otherwise, my phone is getting cut off.
Saturday, I probably won't do anything, but I could go see the Rocky Horror Music Show at Asheville Music Hall if I wanted to. Sunday, TAHP plays
Rare Bird Farm from 2-4. I'll end up with some more time off after that and will still need to be saving money.
	Of course, I'm also expecting to recieve a payment from Travis soon. I need to make sure I am charging enough money for that work.

Sunny venmoed me the money I needed for my cell bill, so that will help a little. Now I only need to pay this week's rent and the parking ticket.
I hope we make more at the golf club than we did last time, but I'm not sure how much it is/was. I probably won't be able to pay both this week
and next week's rent with it, but I should definitely be settled up on rent after Rare Bird Farm. Next week will be very light if Biltmore check
doesn't come through, but I will be getting plenty of money the week after that! I am happy to have this way of organizing my thoughts again. It
is too much for my journal, but needed for my brain. All the possibilities of thoughts pass through this noggin, but these are the ones that actually
make sense.
