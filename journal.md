	-VIII.IXXX.XXIII-

So much rain this morning. I was blissed out every time I woke up, especially to see that it was consistently earlier than I expected. I made coffee, swiped on the dating apps, messaged with the two
girls I had been talking to before bed and just lazed around. I made a second coffee and started watching Eminem videos on youtube, basically his most violent stuff.

	-IX.V-

I still have thoughts about how to improve this journal, but maybe not yet the motivation to implement them. Namely, I want to be able to finish writing about the day before, but on the day after. 

	-IX.XIII-

I've decided to just start one master journal file. Today I slept until 12:30, probably because I was up late designing keyboards. Erica will be returning tomorrow, and I think I am excited about that,
but I can tell life is about to be very different. Fall is coming. I am healing. I have a lot of gigs in October, and I plan to spend less time at the bar. I think I really wanted to find someone to
love while the summer was still around, but now I can accept that that may not be happening, and I am very much remembering how to love myself. My daily phone activities are really starting to take a
long time. I remember when I was writing in my journal three years ago, it was: "I woke, made coffee, played wordle, scrolled on my phone and got to work." Since then, I have added daily and regular
chess puzzles, but I think the amount of content I consume on Instagram has doubled at least. I follow so many more people, and they just post so much more content than before. Even keeping up with
Sadhguru content is a major time commitment. But yes, I made coffee and have casually been bringing things up from the basement.  
  
Lucy is back in town now. I don't know who will reach out to whom first (probably she will to me because me contacting her is usually fruitless,) but it has probably been a month since I've seen 
her and I am very excited to reconnect. Since I haven't said this anywhere else, I will say I don't miss the sexual aspect of our relationship at all, but I'm glad we explored it just a little. I don't
even know *who* I would most like to have sex with these days aside from Lauren Squires, who is much younger than me and soon leaving town. I've been trying to integrate the various things into my room that 
have just been laying around in the basement or storage room since Erica left. I found a place for my records, but also found a very sweet love note from Cait in the process. I thought it would make me feel 
more sad than it even did. It was good to remember the love she felt, even if the sentence-to-sentence transitions felt a little forced. I'd be curious to read some of the things I wrote for her, especially 
the one that made her ask if I was feeling depressed.  
  
I set this journal to be backed up on github, messed with the markdown formatting practices and stole Juan's queen. I think it's nearly time for some more coffee. Then I changed my journal macro so that
it changes into the journal directory and edits the file. That way, I'll already be in the correct location for adding, commiting and pushing to github.

. . .  

I drove to Foundry, ordered a burger and set up my drums. The burger (always something strange there,) came in a bowl. We played a fun set with appearances by Max, Trey and Nex. I drank two-and-a-half
Domingas and then drove to the Brew Pump for a gose. Travis and Brody were both being very weird. Lamont was out front and I found it preferable to hang with him. They stayed open til 11, so I had plenty
of time to savor my beverage. Then, I drove Erica's truck home, brushed my teeth, walked to the Country Club and hung out with Kate, Fiona, Sarah, Kevin and my new PI friend John. I told him I would make
a good detective and even cracked one of his cases re Elliott Moss. Kate was being very friendly. I would have hung out with her as long as possible, but I had to go meet Kathryn, who was hanging out with
Jennifer, who's name I blanked on for a very awkward few moments. Once the bar closed, I walked home, drank two more porters, smoked weed and watched music videos. I'm not sure how this favored pasttime
of mine will work with Erica being back in the house.

	-IX.XIV-

I woke somewhat hungover and didn't do anything for a long time. I was farting up a storm but in a very good mood. I made some iced coffee, cleaned both fridges and took out the trash etc. before walking
to the market for coffee and Ingles for floss, a comb, paper towels, pineapple slices, ramen, grape juice and bologna. I even saw Chuck for the first time in like five years. I walked home, put my groceries
away and wrote in my journal.

. . .

It took me an hour and 10 minutes to get down Brevard Rd to the airport, but Erica's plane had been forced to sit on the tarmac for just as long. I went to the bar at the gas station there and sat with some
people who were also waiting to pick up friends from Charlotte. Apparently the restrooms were closed at the gas station and the terminal alike, so things were getting a little chaotic, not to mention the
amount of traffic. Apparently they were waiting because five airplanes had landed at once, and there are only four terminals. I messaged Bakingpy, curious to whether Keebio  would like to stock Rebound Rev 5.
We drove home, smoked some weed from Belgium and talked about keyboards while I played YouTube videos and farted around on Discord. I went to bed fairly early but kept waking up to drink juice. 
I remember at one of those times that it was 4:00AM.

	-IX.XV-

I had been having vivid dreams about being in an open-air play directed by Will Ferrell, but there was much sabatoge and mystery in the way things unfolded. I slept til 1PM and woke overwhelmed by the amount
of texts on my phone. I went downstairs, made coffee, came back up, opened Wordle on my computer, struggled with it, wrote in my journal and asked Bakingpy what the contract details would be, if any.

. . .

Francis came over and we talked with Erica about the possibility of him moving in. It kinda doesn't seem
 like it's going to work unless he downsizes a lot of stuff and finds ways to not need so much validation
from us. We went to the Brew Pump after that and had a nice time. Francis eventually went home. Erica went
to UJ for a burger, and I met up with Lucy. She bought two IPA six packs and a 12er of Topo Chicos. We rode
drunkenly to her house and stayed up all night drinking and listening to music/jamming along with it.

	-IX.XVI-

I woke and poured a Topo Chico over ice, followed by another. I was supposed to have a date at 2PM in Asheville
but really wanted to back out of it. We lolly gagged around Lucy's house for a while and then drove to mine.
"Do you want me to tuck you in?" she said. I did. In actuality, we hung out with Erica in the back yard while I
drank coffee and they tried to play flutes. I remembered I had most of an Oatmeal Porter, and so shared it with
her. My date backed out, and I eventually walked up to the dispensary with Erica to play a gig with Ryan. I was
not playing very well, to be honest, probably because I was drunk. Fursty didn't seem to be in the most focused
mood either, probably because he's going to be a father any day now. He gave us a ride home and I basically went 
straight to bed. Yes, it was lights out by 7PM, but I kept waking up and drinking juice until about 4AM.

	-IX.XVII-

I'm not sure what I did with my morning, but eventually I drove to a house party in deep Swanannoa where
Dulci, Charlie and I played a couple hours of very fun music. I was the last one there, quietly enjoying
a beer by the fire. The owners finally calmed down from party mode, sat with me and discussed all things
spiritual/Christian. I drove home after that, smoked weed with Erica in the basement and won like five
games of chess on my phone.


	-IX.XVIII-

I was sleeping hard til 11 but very much wanted to talk downtown. It was definitely the coldest morning
in many months. I decided to just leave the house and head straight for Battle Cat, where I drank most
of a shot of espresso. I continued downtown and started to feel awake after I had crossed the bridge.
I sat at my secret spot below Little Bee for a moment, went to the bank, deposited $50 and then made my
way to the Asheville Club (having a quick chat with Mad Mike along the way.) There, I had a Guinness +
espresso and decided to go about my day.

I walked back to the west side and decided to pee at the Country
Club. I couldn't resist drinking half a margarita sour in the sun after that. I made my way toward
the house and passed Erica in the church lot on her way to get her hair cut. I went home, grabbed
my chess board and my weed and then walked to the Brew Pump. I set up the chess board and had a 
couple beers with grant, but never found an opponent. Once the sun started going down, I got chilly,
headed home and basically just shut down. I definitely wasn't able to sleep very easily, but I just
hung out on my phone and not on my phone until at least 2AM. 


	-IX.XIX-

I slept til 11, played Wordle, made coffee, wrote in my journal, got caught up on Discord, made more
coffee and wrote in my journal some more. I did some Hinge swiping, got JLC quotes for Madeline at 50 & 100x, made some Drashna-
requested updates to Palmetto, deleted a bunch of emails, did my chess puzzles, finished my coffee and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I went to the Brew Pump for one People's Porter and then down to Blob rehearsal with Jackson filling in on Tele, which was very fun.
It was cold on the walk home. I made some noodles, won one game of chess in bed and fell asleep at a reasonable hour.

	-IX.XX-

I was worried about Erica. Her basement door was open and I hadn't heard any sign of her by 10AM.
By 11:30 though, I finally heard the shower running. I made some coffee, played Wordle (Snare in six,) scrolled on the dating
apps, looked at  social media and listened to Shabang, or, watched all the videos, technically.

. . .

I mainly relaxed, made some ramen until Kevin reconfirmed that he would be able to give me a ride to Scott McMicken rehearsal,
at which point I walked up to the Pump and had a half porter. We had the best, most surreal hang at Scott's house. I already 
feel like we are friends. The music was great and we definitely bonded over grapes and purple drinks. I was expecting to run
through material from Shabang, but he ended up showing us some rough ideas he was working on, and we had a very natural way of
working together under his thoughtful leadership. Kevin drove me home and I went straight to bed.

	-IX.XXI-

Woke, drank coffee, did all the things and contacted Gary around noon, who was more than happy to pick me up and in the neighborhood.
We had lunch at Botiwalla and then headed to his house and loaded up his trailer. We took a load to his new place, unloaded it,
got some essentials from Ingles and then packed a bit more with Ryan and Melissa around. We ate pizza and took another load to his new
place, after which I went home and straight to bed again.

	-IX.XXII-

I was very tired from moving. I had coffee etc. and decided to tinker around with my Palmetto build. I was going to change out the bottom
row when I realized how truly warped the PCB was. I decided I would make use of the switchplate Travis had sent me, so I desoldered the
whole board and made use of some three-pin Box Browns Erica had in the basement. I still need to order an o-ring and maybe figure out
some gaskets, but, after modifying the keymap a bit and changing to SA Filco Navy, I am having quite a nice time typing on this keyboard.

I was typing about this in the terminal and just figured I would switch to the journal since it is fairly relevant and coherant.
I just added four tiny pieces of foam to the north and south side of the Palmetto PCB, which has created a better typing sound, prevents any keys
from scraping, and keeps the PCB inside the case when turned upside down. It's always amazing what a little dampening can do.

I spent most of the night struggling with SSH PHP and a short in the keyboard. I never could get bluehost to stop complaining
about to many failed login attemps. I finally got PHP working after much fooling. The reason I was trying to do this stuff is that
Lucy called and said she wanted to get next week and have me make her a website in exchange for massage+weed. I should have tried
to tackle the fact that my keyboard was shorting out first, but I thought it was a problem with tap code delay because it was only
happening when I held down spacebar to use my mods. It turns out that's actually when I was just hitting the keyboard the hardest, and so I was
probably pushing the PCB into the bottom of the case. In addition to all this, I deleted my github SSH key, so now I can't even push changes. I was feeling
pretty frantic so I decided to close all my tabs and restart my computer. Oh, I've also been meaning to respond to Alison on Hinge,
who seems pretty into me. Ah man, I'm not even gonna be able to push this journal entry. Which item do I tackle first? Alison!

I fixed SSH for github and even for bluehost. I smoked a bowl with Erica and placed the diodes for Rebound 5, then routed all the rows
and columns.

	-IX.XXIII-

Woke around 8:30, made coffee and learned about/set up SSHFS. Now my bluehost server is essentially just a folder on my computer.
I did my chess and Wordle and pruned some QMK branches as well.

. . .

A very scattered Lucy picked me up around 10:45. We got an oil change in her car, then ate at the Waffle House in Canton.
We went to her house for about half an hour while she changed clothes, etc., and then drove to Box Turtle. We helped move
with Galen and Rachel, and eventually Jamie. We took two trailer loads to the new house and then all went out to eat at
The Madness, and were joined by Darwin and Zelda as well. Lucy and I were very tired after that, so we drove to her house
and watched silly videos on her phone until we fell asleep.

	-IX.XXIV-

Woke, drove to my house and had coffee with Lucy. I started putting together a personal discography, made some noodles and
then worked on Rebound Rev 5, mainly importing 3D models and fixing mounting hole areas. I also imported the MCU. I think
my next step will be to mirror the diodes and pins on the right side so that the board is more symmetrical. Currently I'm
stalling by doing laundry and writing in my journal.

I did mirror the diodes, made more noodles and rerouted everything including the path for rows and cols to the MCU. I also
made my bed, folded all my laundry, swept the floor, took a bath and drank some water.

	-IX.XXV-

I woke and made coffee etc. I had slept very solidly through the night, freakishly so. It could have been because my phone was on silent
and messages was not open on my computer. It could have been the clean bed sheets, or the very light diet. Lucy came over 
and we started on her website, eventually went to Pizza Mind, and then Kevin's house to let out the Hymanberg dogs because
little Max was born today. We went back to my house, worked a little more, until rush hour when Lucy decided to leave. The
website is simple but good. I laid in bed for a bit and then made some too-late coffee and worked on Rebound Rev 5, connecting
the rows, columns and encoder to the MCU, and fixing the edge-related problems. I also routed the bottom row.

My computer has been getting slower and slower, a problem which I attribute to the hard disk, so I decided I would try installing
a fresh version of Linux Mint onto a USB. I played with that for a bit and realized that running a bootable disk and installing
a copy are not really the same thing, so I'm currently writing another boot disk so that I can hopefully install to the first
one while writing in my journal. I also replaced the SA Filco Navy keycaps on my Palmetto with GMK Classic Blue, so now I'm typing on
nearly $700 worth of keyboard while eating ramen, and using all Carolina Mech products to boot.

. . .

I installed Chrome and KiCad easily. The iMac's hard disk mounted automatically, so I just dragged my SSH keys and scripts into the new OS.
I was then able to clone my keyboard design repository and noticed that KiCad was opening and running much faster. That's when I 
realized the pins on my USB port weren't labelled correctly, so, after being unable to copy and paste an HRO-type symbol, I just edited
the symbol I had to match in terms of pin names. I routed D+ and D- minus after that, felt tired and went to sleep.

	-IX.XXVI-

Woke at 9:17, went downstairs, made coffee, talked with Erica about installing OSes and old macbooks, made a second cup, came upstairs,
cloned my journal onto the new OS and wrote in it. I played Wordle, installed QMK and then routed VBUS and the 5.1K resistors on Rebound
Rev 5.

. . .

I realized it was almost time to go to practice, so I made some bologna ramen, scarfed it down and hopped in the car with Kev. We went to
pick up Steve Okonski in Biltmore Village and then rode to Scott's house where we hung on the deck, played some great tunes, took a walk
in the woods, played some more tunes and said our goodbyes. We took Steve home and showed up 20 minutes late to Dulci practice. Kev was
munching on a bag of tortilla chips, and I grabbed some handfuls as well. Jackson is sounding really good for only two rehearsals, and I
jealously would like to play with him more often. It was a long practice, but went by very fast. I walked home to Erica, Brody and Mark starting
a game of Chinese checkers. I took a PBR tallboy out of the fridge without asking, packed some of Mark's weed in my pipe and came in second
place. I was tired and starving. I laid down in the living room while Mark ran his mouth. Erica basically eventually told him it was time to leave,
at which point I cooked some random noodles with parmejean and dill relish. I ate that and fell fast asleep.

	-IX.XXVII-

I woke, looked at Instagram, watched a 311 video, hopped on Reddit for a minute, played Wordle and eventually made some coffee. I talked with
Erica for a minute about the previous night's adventures and then came upstairs and wrote in my journal.

. . .

She went to the grocery store and I made more coffee. I eventually took a bath, and then used the truck to drive to Foundry.
I loaded in my drums, ate a burger and played a very fun set to -- for most of the night -- nobody but the bartender and her 
high school friend Nicole, who works at Battery Park Book Exchange. They admitted they were old HGTR fans, and in fact part
of the team that won a high school lip synch competition with Getting Over Your Love.

I ended up having two more beers after the set for some reason. I guess I was enjoying talking to the guy from Ohio. I 
was going to go to Ingles with my $7 in tips, but somehow ended up at the Brew Pump instead. I drank a gose, talked to
Miles and Nick and Jamie, drove home and smoked weed with Erica while subjecting her to Scot McMicken demos over her
bluetooth speakers. When I walked upstairs at 1AM, I went straight to sleep.

	-IX.XVIII-

Woke, looked at Facebook and Instagram, played Wordle, made coffee and wrote in my journal. I worked on Rebound Rev 5 and
walked to Ingles with $2 in my wallet, which got me two packs of ramen and a can of chili, so I made that when I got
home and realized it was literally spaghetti. I ate that and wrote in my journal.

. . .

Instead of outright cancelling my date, I informed Alison that I had literally $2 in my wallet. She said that was fine,
she understood and would buy me a drink, and also wanted to go to Cascade. I walked down there at 5 and had a very nice,
casual two caliente margaritas with her. She was as attractive as I had hoped she would be, and seemed less anxious than
she led me to believe. I walked to Ingles in a slight drizzle, bought one more pack of ramen thanks to the two dimes I
had found there earlier, walked home and added Cirque breakouts to Rebound. I smoked some weed, too. I don't remember 
what else I did, but I was tired and it was soon 11:00, and so I went to sleep.

	-IX.XXIX-

My alarm was set for 9AM and it felt like that had come and gone, but it was truly taking forever. Someone was outside
smacking a hammer so timidly. I really hope it was the teenager. Once my alarm went off, I got up, made coffee, chatted
with Erica, played Wordle (Azure in two,) browsed discord and wrote in my journal.

. . .

Kev and I drove to Starbucks and then Scott's house, where we worked on Ordinary Guy and a Calypso-type idea. It was
very fun to play and hang as a three-piece. I came home, made some spaghetti, and then rode with Kev and Alyse to 
Charlie's house where we had a final rehearsal in the backyard with Jackson. There was Guinness, frozen mimosas,
very strong margaritas in a can. I came home at 10:30 and went promptly to bed.

	-IX.XXX.-

I woke a little before 8, made some coffee, moved my drums out to the porch, played Wordle and waited for Jackson. 
We rode together and chatted all the way to Red Oak, which was indeed massive and swamped with people. I ate a 
brat, drank a bunch of bachs and played a loud and fun set. I was tired on the way home. Jackson still did a lot
of talking. I ate a bag of jalapino cheddar Cheetos, a slice of sausage gas station pizza, a carton of grapes 
and a coffee. I was home by 8:45. Erica was out and I went straight to bed.

	-X.I-

I think I had had weird dreams with Cait; I woke up thinking about her and feeling lonely. I swiped on Bumble,
found the literal girl of my dreams, and then accidentally swiped left while trying to look at her Instagram.
It seemed like she was friends with Lizzy Ross, so I spent a while trying to find her through both of her
social media accounts. I couldn't remember her name, only that she went to UNC and was from Pittsboro. I fell
back asleep and awoke feeling refreshed, not bothered by either inconvenience.

My tentative plans were to go to Walgreens for the sake of adding cash to my PayPal, and then Aldi, but I didn't
want to do anything. I thought about just going to Ingles but decided against it. I fell back asleep, and then
woke to the notion that I was starting to have weird dreams again. I was starting to feel as annoyed as before.
My phone buzzed saying I had a message from Lyndsay on Bumble. When I opened it, it was from Lyndsay Pruett. We
came to the conclusion that we would like to hang out with each other whenever she got home from tour.

I walked down to Cascade to watch Krave Amiko. They were stylistically a little dated and definitely over-
performative, but also crushing it most of the time. I drank a Guinness and felt readyish to leave. I wanted to
see what the next band was about, as well, so I was feeling indecisive. I went into the bar for another drink, and
then, after a couple minutes, decided I would leave. I was standing around talking to Pam when she offered to give
me a brat for free, so I sat and ate that with her, and then wandered to the back again to see what the music was
like. Acklen Walker was rapping my feelings, and a tall skinny shaved-headed drummer was playing just what I would
have played.

Once he did an all-singing song, however, I decided to walk up the hill. My exchange with Lyndsay got increasingly
flirty. I went home, put on more clothes, brushed my teeth and drove Erica's truck to South Slope. We checked out
the new Tiki Easy in the back of Hi-wire and were underwhelmed, so we decided to go next door to Ben's Tune up,
where we had heard the sound of reggae. We had two drinks there (her Old Crow and me Dominga,) and then kissed in
the parking lot. She was going home because she had to teach from noon to five, then play a gig with Cynthia. I 
drove home and laid in bed. She texted first, and we eventually said goodnight.

	-X.II-

I woke, played Wordle, walked to Battle Cat, had an Americano, went to SECU downtown, then to the Asheville Club
for a Guinness. I meditated in the park for a few minutes and then walked back to the West Side. I saw Scott's car
parked near Battle Cat and correctly assumed he was there. He was outside talking to Greg about their upcoming 
Double Crown show. I said hello to both of them and then went to Ingles where I bought soy ramen x2, a big pack of
super thick-cut bologna, some arugula, a can of pineapple slices and a bottle of muscadine grape juice for $13.56.
I went home, made food, made coffee, smoked weed with Erica and spaced out while she talked about Cornhole, Frank's
bone cancer, robins, squirrels, flutes, chipmunks, Emacs, QMK userspaces, key combos, getting rid of stuff, Francis
living with Drew, how shady Retrocade is and more. I eventually had to come upstairs for some quiet time and to write
in my journal.

I walked to Aldi, bought more ramen, more greens, more muscadine, some bananas and a mint chocolate bar for $12.26.
I went to the Brew Pump after that, had one gose with Fuckchop, Adam, Adam, Brodie, Bryan and Rob.

. . . (Seems like some journal went missing?)

I went home, took a bath, did all kinds of random cleanup on Rebound and went to bed fairly early.

	-X.III-

I woke at 9, made coffee, rode with Kevin to Scott's house, worked on three or four tunes, went back to the west side,
got dropped off on Haywood Rd., had a free gose at the pump with Brodie, Travis and Michel, walked home, made food,
talked to Erica, laid in bed, listened to the Scott tunes and wrote in my journal. I was hoping to go see Lyndsay
play at Five Walnut, but she indicated that she was very very tired, so I backed out, which she said she appreciated.
It does make me wonder, but it's definitely not worth over-wondering. I'm just not sure what I'm going to do with my evening.
Spending money on food sounds fun, but saving money and saying home seems much more wise.

. . .

And stay home I did. I got my SSH and SSHFS working under my new operating system. I never fully understood what the
error was, nor the solution, but a bit of brute force copypasta and trying everything seemed to work eventually.
I laid in bed for a while and then decided to title all of the Scott memos, convert them to mp3 and host them on
my bluehost server. Before that, I looked at the Sea Picro reset circuit, noticed it was complicated and went to
lay in the bed. 

	-X.IV-

I woke up at 930 after long intense dreams of seemingly remembering I had helped Sunny bury a body. I also posted up
printed labels with QR codes that would load songs for somebody as they were leaving our complex. I played Wordle,
swiped on the dating apps, checked social media, Discord, got up, went downstairs, made coffee, laid in the hammock
and felt totally blissed out. My life may not be this way forever, but everything is good right now. I made a second
cup of coffee, reviewed my browser history and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I had a porter at the Brew Pump and then walked down to Kevin's house to make a High Like Rainbows theme with
Fwuit for David the Windowman. It really only took us about a half-hour to get a suitable demo. The rest of the
hang gave me anxiety. I was literally just sitting on the front porch with Kevin and Dulci, but it seemed like 
there wasn't anything to talk about, particularly with Dulci. Though, admittedly, I was the most silent one. We
had a productive rehearsal after that with lots of snacks. I walked home, passing Ryan along the way, and fell 
quickly asleep.

	-X.V-

I'm realizing now that my quality of sleep has been a lot better recently. When I first moved into Erica's, I was
waking up very often, and then every couple hours. Now, it seems like once I fall asleep, I stay asleep until the
sun is up, at least. This morning I made coffee, played Wordle and rode with Kevin to Scott's house. They were
chopping up brush piles in a chipper for most of the rehearsal, but we managed to record nine memos. We ordered
lunch from Taqueria Fast and I was the weirdo with the torta. We ate inside the house and all the questions seemed
to be aimed at Steve. Maybe people just know I'm a simple guy without a lot of lore.

As we were leaving Scott's, I caught myself letting out a big sigh and realized I had been more anxious than
I realized for most of the day. I had Kev let me off at the Country Club, but it was later than I realized. The
sun was up and the people there were drunk. I did not want to hang out for a second, so after using the bathroom,
I walked home, laid in bed, converted the memos to mp4, hosted them on my web server, listened to them all, laid
in the bed again, swiped on dating apps, drank some juice, ate a banana and wrote in my journal. I think I am feel-
ing better, more self-assured now. I'm just ready for some proper alone time. My walk on Monday was very nice, but
it was followed by an early-morning rehearsal, a canceled date, the jingle writing and two more rehearsals. I now
have a quiet night at home, a whole day off, and then the better part of the next day to relax.

	-X.VI-

I woke up early and walked to Battle Cat where I got a free Americano from Vaydra, sat in the sun and did my phone
stuff. I walked to The Asheville Club, where Dennis was working, had a Guinness+espresso and messaged people on
dating apps. I went to sit in Pritchard Square for a while and then decided to text pretty much everyone I care
about to see what they were up to. I walked up to Pack Library and sat outside for a few minutes until Aurora asked
if I wanted to come over. I started walking back west and went into Ingles to buy some sort of fruit to bring over.
I decided on pineapple and a banana, but when I went up to the self-checkout, someone had left an adult beverage, and
I accidentally scanned it trying to get it out of the way. I just decided to leave the store.

I went down to Aurora's house and caught up with her over tea. She had people coming over at five and invited me to
sit on the couch while she cleaned, but I decided to head up to UJ for a burger and a beer. Actually, I think I had a
gose at the Brew Pump before that. I was even considering making food at home until it started raining. Barbie had
invited me over for franks and dranks. She even texted me saying she would pick me up if I wanted to go to Barnes
& Noble and Target with them, which I did. We went to her house after that and drank IPAs until Miki showed up with
Fruit Smash and Pizza Mind. She had just returned from Puerto Rico. I was suddenly pretty anxious that this was the
kind of event Cait would want to find herself at, but I decided against asking any questions or caring what happened
either way. I fell asleep on the couch around 6:30AM.

	-X.VII-

Miki woke me up and asked me if I had a plan for getting home. I said I was probably going to walk. She said, "Good,
can you do that now?" I think she said Travis was there, which I didn't want to hang around for anyway. I felt 
hungover at first but quickly started feeling pretty good and upbeat. I wandered into Ingles to buy some grape juice
and pineapple and saw Aurora at the self checkout. Someone asked for her Ingles card, but I beat her to it. Then 
she informed the cashier that her payment method needed attention, but I pointed out that she hadn't hit the
continue button on the screen. She offered me a ride, which I decided to take just for fun, and ran off to buy juice,
but returned with a box of clementines. "That's your juice?" she said.

We rode to the liquor store, where she was buying tiny bottles for a friend's pinata and then to my house where I
didn't do much for a while. Eventually, Kevin and Dulci picked me up and we rode to Oskar Blues, where we played
a chilly two hours while being bothered by Marty and Joy. I drank two fruited sours, ate a burger and had a good time.
I had a slight panic attack on the way home, but was just excited to get there where my blinds and door were closed.
I can't remember if I said hi to Erica; I just went into my room, locked my door and relaxed. I even accidentally
fell asleep. I woke at 3AM, ate eight clementines, returned to my room just before the BNB guest returned and fell
back sleep.

	-X.VIII-

I woke early and walked to a very busy Battle Cat for an Americano and did all my phone things. I was supposed to be
meeting with my parents but my dad texted saying he had a cough and would need to reschedule. Lucy had also asked
about hanging out, so I let her know I was now free, and she suggested we go to her house around 6PM. I walked downtown,
had a Guinness and espresso, sat in the park, went back for another Guinness, hung with Reese, poured the remainder of
my beer in my tin cup and started walking east. I had a pee break at the Grey Eagle and then decided to see if Cam was
working. He offered me a free La Folie, so I enjoyed that in the sun and then walked up the hill.

I needed to pee by the time I made it to Urban Orchard, so I walked inside to the bathroom. No one else was in there,
and I did not know the bartender who waved friendily at me, so I decided to have a small cider, what ended up being
a 10OZ pour. I enjoyed talking with her and continued east. I stopped at Cellarist to have a pee. I was thinking about
harrassing Harrison, but decided only to loiter near him instead and see if he ever offered me a beer, which he did
not. I continued east, bought the juice and pineapples I wanted from the store the other morning and walked home
where I had a coffee with Erica. I asked if I could play Scott memos on her nice speakers and was doing so when
Gracie the house guest arrived.

Lucy arrived mere seconds later. We were hungry, so we went to Itto, sat at the bar, got very full and then drove
to Canton. Actually, we went to Weirdo Central first for Marlboro Reds and Mountain Water. We went to her house,
drank vodka/beer and listened to music while she crafted. I played literally every Scott memo I could, and she
eventually took the phone away from me. 

	-X.IX-

Woke and drank coffee. Lucy continued sipping vodka. We talked about maybe going to visit Max, but she continued
to drink and craft. I went to Ingles, got overstimulated and bought three cans of Brut + a hideous lemon. We drank
all that while listening to music and then admited we would not be going to Asheville today. We went back to Ingles,
bought more champagne, a 12-pack of Sour Monkey, three frozen pizzas and oat milk, went back to her house and raged
out. She was admittedly partying harder than me, but I tried. Chuck came over, made a couple of the pizzas, drank
some of the beers and offered up PBRs if we should need them later, which we did. I eventually surrendered, laid
in the bed, let Lucy touch me and returned the favor. She asked if I wanted her to fuck me, and I agreed, so she
put a condom on me. It didn't last terribly long but it was fun and felt good. I think I accidentally threw the
condom under her bed and fell asleep.

	-X.X-

Woke several times to Lucy's complaints of being hungover. She eventually made coffee and cleaned up a little.
I cracked open a PBR before we left. We went to the recycling center and then rode silently to my house, or,
without music at least, which is rare. I drank coffee with Erica and listened to her talk about flutes. I went
upstairs to use the restroom and was quickly followed and interviewed about Shopify. When I sat at my computer
to write in my journal, I was asked more questions until I pretended to be poking around on Discord. 

. . .

I walked to the Brew Pump around five, but there was a sign saying they wouldn't be open until six. I bought a 
six-pack of Mountain Water to share with Charlie for his birthday and then walked down Vance Crescent. As I
expected, Lenny, Libby, Jared and Mark were sitting out in the grass, so I cracked open a beer and had one with
them until 6:00. I walked up to Olney and immediately had Adam pull up his car to me, so I hopped in and rode
to his house on Carrier St. He said he had just started a new job at the custom E-bike shop. I walked down to
the park, sat against a tree and finished my beer.

We worked on Walkin' Boots and some Fleetwood song. Fursty was there for a bit. I walked back up to the Brew
Pump, but they had never opened at all, so I walked home, very much annoyed by the sight of Justin's passing
van. I went to sleep very easily.

	-X.XI-

I had had dreams of needing some kind of surgery, being unable to say hello to Cait, having rehearsal with
Kevin and Dulci at the Biltmore house and more. I woke at nine, made coffee upstairs and hopped in the car
with Kevin. We went to Scott's house and were joined for the first time by Ryan Oslance, and ran through 14
songs. Only 12 memos survived, but it was a very fun day. I was tired on the ride home. Kevin and I sat in
a fair amount traffic. I got out at Brevard Rd., walked home, made a cup of coffee, chatted with Erica, 
asked if I could borrow the truck, loaded it up and drove to Foundry Hotel.

I parked, loaded in my rug and throne, ordered a burger but had to settle for a chicken sandwich. I loaded
in the rest of my gear, ate the crumbly sandwich, finished setting up, ordered a beer, chatted with Dulci,
played two sets feeling like my sticks were heavy and then drove to the Brew Pump where a fundraiser concert
was wrapping up. Most beers were kicked, so I decided on a Jade-and-a-half. I walked home, smoked a bunch
of weed, listened to all the memos, converted them and uploaded them to my web server.

	-X.XII-

I woke to the sound of Erica chatting with the guests, seemingly a lot about me. I stayed in my room until
they were gone, and then walked to retrieve the truck. We needed to use a rock to park it where Erica had
had it before lest it roll down the driveway. I made coffee, laid in bed, ate some ramen and then wrote in
my journal.

. . .

Dulci picked me up and we went downtown to the Lazoom room for a private tour hosted by Scott with Two Ts.
They did not want to go to Highland, so we did a very roundabout tour of downtown, went to New Belgium
and then Wedge where we were joined by Jillian and her boyfriend, who bought me a second beer. I announced
I was going to be a silly goose after the tour was done and went to Brew Pump where I ran into Lucy. We ate
some food and then went to our separate homes. I was worried about being a drunk idiot so I went straight
to bed.

	-X.XIII-

I woke around 1130, snuck out of the house and walked to BattleCat, where I saw Bridget Kearney. I could
barely get any words out, but of course mentioned Scott. Once my heart stopped racing, I walked to
Wall Street where Alex was playing some lovely music. I then went into Asheville Club, had a Guinness,
walked to my bank and back to the club for a shot of espresso and another Guinness. I walked to Grey
Eagle for a pee break and decided to have a beer outside just in case circumstance would lead to Bridget
wanting to talk a little more. I guess that was a bit weird. I went down to Olde London Road, ordered a
smash burger from Grant with fries, ate it, walked up the hill to Urban Orchard and sat next to Allison
for a drink. Jaqueline was bartending. We watched a bit of The Craft.

I walked to Fleetwood's where the bands were loading in and stayed there for probably six hours. I saw
four bands, made some new friends, hung with Juan and Devin and drank probably six more Guinness. I
walked to Country Club after that for two more beers where I had a slightly aggro hangout with George,
Amy, Tawny, and the guy with the little dog on the rope. I asked Tawny for a ride home and she scoffed
at me, so I walked home in the rain, watched a few  music videos including the HGTR Audiotree and went
to sleep.

	-X.XIV-

I woke feeling unwell and made some ramen. I laid around looking at my phone and drinking juice until
3PM when I made coffee and wrote in my journal.

I took a bath, talked to Lucy on the phone, made my bed, ate more ramen and wrote in my journal some more.

. . .

I eventually started to shake my blues away by watching a Dr. Dog concert. Lucy came over around 630 and
got ready while chatting with Erica and me watching music videos. We drove to Botiwalla, but the line
was way out the door, so we went downtown, parked in the garage, walked to Dilbar and ordered some
delicious food. It took a while to come out, and I wasn't being my most conversational. We walked
down to the Orange Peel and she offered to buy my ticket. I wasn't going to let her at first, but
somehow Shopify managed to charge me $50 for my bill through PayPal, which fed into my bank account,
so I took her up on the offer and started to feel like a real bad date.

I bought her a drink and started to enjoy the show while thinking I was a piece of shit, but after
she had gone to grab a second drink, she rubbed against me and said something funny, so I relaxed.
TMOE had an incredible stage presence and a very dynamic way of talking to the crowd, constantly
whispering or speaking in a low gravly voice when not screaming. His rythmic cadence was fascinating
as well, just filling a bit of space between songs. When he played the three I knew, it transported
me to being with Louise, and I realized more than ever, I need to be back on the road somehow.

We heard some amazing karaoke coming from the Lazoom Room, and so popped in for a split second,
then walked back to the garage. We got in a very minor argument about pedestrian right-of-way,
and then I even told her the wrong way to drive home. We laughed though, listened to some music
on my bed and kissed a little until it was time for her to drive to her house to meet her date
who had been working at the Orange Peel. My blues were cured and I was glad to not be very drunk.
I don't remember what I did before falling asleep, probably nothing.

	-X.XV-

I'd slept solidly through the night with dreams of rehearsing in a grocery store, waking only
when the B&B guests left at some ungodly dark hour. I looked at my phone, consuming a lot of
Palestine/Israel content and then, when I heard Erica coming upstairs to strip the bed, snuck
down, made coffee, chatted with her, came back upstairs and wrote in my journal.

I watched some of a much better Dr. Dog live concert from their final tour. I made bologna
ramen, put on nearly-winter clothes and caught a ride with Kevin to the Biltmore where we
played four sets (about two-and-a-half with Fursty.) It was very cold, but an interesting
thing happened where a ton of people gathered under the gazebo during our final set. We
were playing very well and picking some good songs. I came home, smoked a bowl with Erica,
made some ramen, got a message from Aren Fairyfingers on discord and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I ended up making a second bowl of ramen and definitely had a tummy ache while I slept.

	-X.XVI-

I woke and decided it was for sure a zen day. In no particular order, I've made three cups
of coffee, done a load of laundry, wrote in my journal and watched some of Poro Rosso,
scrolled and messaged on the dating apps, talked to Lucy, watched a really boring linux
video, played Wordle, some chess against Charlie plus my daily puzzles and smoked weed.
The cartoon watching has been done from the Macbook Air I haven't used in a long time,
from bed, and something about that is very comforting. I would like to do another load
of laundry, but I don't want to strip the bed.

I spent way too long writing a script that would check how long this file is, subtract
14 from that line number, and then open this file and take me to that line, so, in theory,
as long as I don't change how many trailing lines are at the end of the journal, it should
open to the right line every time. I think it's ultimately an imperfect idea because the
trailing lines probably WILL change, but at least I'll be pretty close, and I think I
had fun scripting. I know there is so much more I could do with Bash if I get my head
wrapped around it again.

I told Erica about what I had done and ended up getting a lesson in Bash. All we really
did was simplify the code and then move it to a separate file, my bin, where things
can be coded into commands. Things are starting to make a little more sense now.

. . .

I watched Ginger and Rosa, mainly because of Elle Fanning, and thought it was a great
film. I had to break it up into small chunks, but I actually finished, which is rare
for me. I slept well after that.

	-X.XVII-

I woke, asked Sunny for money for her unused cellphone plan, and then called Google
asking for an extension on my bill. The lady did a bit of scolding, but eventually
offered me three whole extra days. Erica went somewhere in the truck without saying
anything while I was on hold. I made coffee after that, did my Wordle, did some free-
writing, made some more coffee and then wrote in my journal. I think I will change
my journal folder into a writing folder, and then change readme.md into journal.md
and freewrite.md. And I can add other projects into there if needed. It seems like
a need to write is slowly surfacing in an organic way. It could just be because I'm
stuck at home with no money and the weather was cold yesterday, but I am going to 
follow my instinct.

I decided a txt file was better for freewriting and left the journal as markdown.
I changed the journal command to "scribe" and then created aliases such that the
journal command "j" is now "scribe journal.md" and "fw" is "scribe freewrite.txt".
I also made another cup of coffee.

I watched the entire episode 4 of The Irrational listening for Only Darkness,
which was placed somewhere in the show, but I didn't ever hear it. I heard a LOT
of subtle ominous chugga chuggas though, so it's probably in there somewhere. I
walked toward Ingles after that and ran into Ryan at the marmer's farket. I put
my hands over his eyes from behind and he said, "I literally have no idea who
this is." How could he? We chatted for a sec, and then I walked across the street
and bought beef ramen x6, pineapple slices, muscadine juice, arugula, butter  and
bologna for $18.95. I tried frying my bologna in butter and think I used a little too much
butter. I also tried cutting my pineapple slices down from three to two, which
I think is a mistake when having a lot of greens. I ate that. It smelled a little
funny, but tasted okay. Then I wrote in my journal.

I wrote an alias that makes a copy of my bashrc in my bin folder, and then turned
that folder into a git repository. I opened HBO Max and saw that the Phillies game
would be broadcast, so I tuned into that, but there was a half-hour left of pre-
game, so I watched the first episode of the latest season of South Park. 

. . .

I watched the most of Phillies/D-Backs game, until the Phillies were about 8-0,
and decided to turn it off. I think I mainly recited love mantras after that
until I fell asleep.

	-X.XVIII-

I woke to the sound of Erica leaving the house, presumeably for coffee. I made
an upstairs cup and drank it while contentedly looking at my phone. I started
a huge load of laundry after that and then made a second cup downstairs and
shot the breeze with Erica. We talked about temperature, small computers,
Suzana, arrogance, tour, the Brew Pump, the metric system and chipmunks. I
made a third coffee, came upstairs and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I cooked noodles, made my bed, folded laundry, brushed my teeth, took a bath
and walked up to the Brew Pump where I had two porters before walking down
to Malvern Hills. I accidentally flirted with Lindsey for a bit while Courtney
stood suspiciously, and then walked down to Kevin's house where we had a fun
rehearsal in a slightly reorganized room. I walked up to the Brew Pump for one
more gose, which was a good idea because I could hear Taylor raising hell
on her porch as I walked down Brevard Rd. I smoked a bit with Erica and made
two batches of buttery noodles before falling asleep.

	-X.XIX-

I woke at 930 and consumed way too much Israel/Palestine content. I got up 
and made coffee around 1130, went upstairs and wrote in my journal.

. . .

At 130, I walked down to Middlemont, met Max and had rehearsal with Tina,
Ryan and Melissa. Ry and Mel were doing a lot of trading off on tunes so
that one could brush up while the other tended to Max. It worked surprisingly
well. I walked quickly up to the house, made a big lunch, put on some
warmer clothes and got picked up by Dulci to go check out Josh Phillips'
studio. We waited him from the agreed-upon time of 6:00 until 6:25 and
decided to give up. He finally called when we were back in West Asheville
and said he could be there in half an hour, so we went to Starbucks
(my fifth coffee) and back to the studio by 7:00.

He still wasn't there, but he told us how to get in and showed up looking
wild, drinking a White Claw about a half hour later. The studio was
slightly dingy without a ton of isolation, but the recording equipment
was top notch and there were all kinds of keyboard instruments, so
Dulci and I decided it would be better than recording at Drop of Sun.
We hung out there until 8:30 and went home. I watched Erica fix a flute
and then sat on my bed hoping that the Biltmore money would come through.
I did that, picking my scalp until midnight, when I decided to get undressed.
It was a slow, stubborn process of getting ready to sleep, but I eventually
did it, naked in the darkness. I refused to be anything other than
accepting of the fact that I had had five cups of coffee that day.

	-X.XX-

Slept til nearly noon, having all kinds of dreams. Dulci had paid me for
Biltmore, so I transferred that to my bank and then sent Erica rent for
the week. I went downstairs, made a cup, noticed it was raining, talked
with Erica about woodpeckers, made a second cup, came upstairs and wrote
in my journal.

I took a bath, brushed my teeth, started getting dressed, took my drums
out on the porch and scrolled on my phone. Cleaning Ryan came over and
Erica gave me a nug of weed. I answered a phone call from a number that
had been calling me for days, and it was a lady thanking me for my
support to the republican party. I failed a couple Monkeytypes after
that and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I rode with Dulci to the Mt. Mitchell golf club in crazy weather. I
loaded in my rug and throne, ordered a burger, finished setting up
my drums and ate my burger in the corner of the bar overlooking the
golf course. Dulci joined me and we talked about Palestine for a minute.
We went to the car and smoked a bowl, and then hurried back inside
because the wind was getting so crazy. I sat back in my corner and
drank my beer until I guessed that Kevin was set up. We played a
challenging but fun set, most of it to three enthusiastic  people.

We loaded out and I rode home with Dulci, chatting the whole way,
even spilling the tea on some people. I went inside, smoked a bowl
in the basement with Erica and decided it was time to lay down. I
think I laid awake in bed for a long time.

	-X.XXI-

I had had many crazy dreams and started to wake up around 8AM.
Actually, I fell back asleep until I heard Erica checking on me and
leaving the house around noon. I laid in bed mostly scrolling on
my phone until 2:00, when I decided to write in my journal.

. . .

I walked up to the Brew Pump and passed our B&B guest on the way.
I had two porters and some Saag Paneer from Dilbar while texting
Aurora about a possible guestlist spot for the Rocky Horror Music
Show at Asheville Music Hall. She said, "I only had one and I gave
it to Frank. :P but please come anyway?" I said, "When you ask
like that, what choice do I have?"

I walked home, put on more clothes, hit the bowl and walked downtown
very quickly. Dennis, Sierra, Squid, Reese and Nick were hanging
out outside The Asheville Club. Dustin excitedly asked if I wanted
a pint of Guinness and a shot of espresso, so I couldn't decline.
I drank those, walked around the corner to the Music Hall and really
enjoyed the opening band, the fake wedding cover band. They played
She Came In Through The Bathroom Window, Ophelia, Wild Night and
a couple others. I really want to be in that band.

The show was great, aside from Steph being mostly unable to act.
I saw some amazing jazz funk down in One Stop, smoked a bowl on
the sidewalk with a stranger and then called Aurora asking for a
ride home. She instead took me to a hangout at Kevin's house for
his birthday. He showed me some sort of N64 Smash Brothers mod,
which I protested. I went to Country Club after that, but it was
slow and boring, so I drunkenly had a Pernicious at the Alley Cat
while watching amazing karaoke. I walked home, watched music videos
for an hour-and-a-half and fell asleep.

	-X.XXII-

I was reluctant to get up, but had enough time to drink two cups of
coffee, get dressed, unload my drums, play Wordle, etc. Fursty and
I rode to Starbucks, then out to Rare Bird Farm where we had a very
fun Tina & Her Pony set inside a great sounding barn followed by a
super chill outhouse porch sit led by me. We took the windy drive
home and I laid in the darkness for a while before deciding to order
Dominos and write in my journal.

. . .

I wanted to watch baseball, but it was not on, so I watched three or
four episodes of South Park instead before falling fast asleep.

	-X.XXIII-

I was awoken by the faint sound of Erica desperately asking if I was
home. I said I was, and exited my room. She was saying she felt like
a bear coming out of her cave. I made a cup of coffee and was just
assaulted by her talking about whatever, following along with my
Wordle game, etc. I used the restroom, scrolled on my phone and 
wrote in my journal.

. . .

I walked to Ingles, bought some blackberries and a banana and ate
them on the way to Battle Cat. I drank an Americano in the sun
and decided to walk downtown to the bank. I went to the Asheville
Club after that and met up with Aren Blake. We had two beers and
then went to check out drum machines at his house. We shared an
IPA there and then went to the West Side after picking up a sixer
of Mountain Water. We drank and checked out keyboards, and I
eventually retired to my room for music video hour.

	-X.XXIV-

I woke, looked at my phone, made coffee and wrote in my journal.

. . .

At 2:50, I walked up to the Brew Pump, but the Mexican truck was
not yet open, so I went over to UJ and had a burger with tots and
a Coke. I slipped back over to the Pump for two beers and then
walked down to rehearsal. Charlie shared with me a Flanders red
from Zilacoah while we ran through Take It Easy, Donna, Don't
Have To Try, Walk on By, Perhaps, Get Out Of My Head, More Than
You Can Take plus maybe more.

I walked back up to the Pump, had two more porters, walked home
and soon went to bed.

	-X.XXV-

I slept til almost 1PM, dreaming about all kinds of fighter jets
and camps and stuff. I made a coffee, drank one with Erica,
made another, came upstairs, sat on the couch and checked to
see if anything had happened on the internet. After that, I
made my bed, tidied my room and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I drove the truck downtown at 5:15, loaded in my drums and ate
some steak skewers. We played a fun set and were joined by
Aren Blake and Deacon | Dale. I took Aren to the Brew Pump for
one after that, and upon him realizing Ubers were $23, I gave
him a ride home, drank a PBR and met his girlfriend. I went
to the Country Club after that, had two margarita sours and
went home to listen to some tunes and sleep.

	-X.XXVI-

I woke after noon feeling less tired than the day before, but 
very thirsty. I drank three cups of coffee in the basement
with Erica and then made some ramen with bologna, arugula and
red bell pepper. After that, I wrote in my journal.

. . .

I ate a weed gummy, finished season 26 of South Park, rewatched 
Six Days to Air for the first time since it came out and fell asleep

	-X.XXVII-

I slept til nearly noon, woke, drank a cup of coffee with Erica,
came upstairs, brushed my hair, drank another cup of coffee, 
took a bath, trimmed my mustache area, cut my toenails, made a
lunch of undercooked noodles with collard greens and bologna,
ate a weed gummy, watched season 25 of South Park, ate another
gummy, watched season 24 (The Pandemic Special), ate another gummy,
watched The Vaccination Special, ate another gummy,  watched all
10 episodes of Season 23 and fell asleep.

	-X.XXVIII-

I woke to a beautiful day, drank a cup of coffee in the hammock,
went to Ingles, bought a pack of ramen and a can of pineapple
slices, saw Brody, came home, had another cup of coffee and 
smoked a bowl with Erica, made lunch (soy ramen, bologna, pineapple,
collard greens) and wrote in my journal.

. . .

Dulci picked me up and we rode to the Biltmore, where we were joined
by Alyse and new puppy Charli. We had a very easy day of music with
beautiful weather. I took my $17 in tips to Ingles for two bags of
ramen, had three porters at the Brew Pump, smoked a bowl with Erica
and then watched the first three episodes from Season 22 of South
Park and fell asleep.

	-X.XXIX-

I woke around 7AM, did Wordle, scrolled memes and fell back asleep
to an intense Cait dream. I woke up again around 1030, texted Ryan
asking about a ride, made a cup of coffee and wrote in my journal.

. . .

Ryan and I rode to Sierra Nevada, where we played a fun and silly
set. Lots of friends were there including Dad, Daniel, Molly, Finn,
Jenny(?), Ryan O'Keef, Alish, Melissa, Max, Megan & Miguel and
little Charli. I felt a little wonky when I got home and so I
rested a while. I really wanted to go to a new bar, especially
after Facebook served me a video of Anthony Bordain walking around
NYC going to his favorite spots. I scrolled on Maps for a while
and actually realized there was a brand new place with the perfect
vibe right around the corner.

The Low Down is the closest bar to me, in fact. I had a Left Hand
Nitro Stout and went over to the Country Club for a porter and a
to-go Guinness. I forgot to mention I had shared some of an
Outsider Darkcider with Erica, courtesy of Charlie. I just laid
in bed and felt life for a while.

	-x.xxx-

I woke and decided after debating throughout the night that it was
walking day. Battle Cat was closed, so I went straight to the
Asheville Club where Sal was bitching with the GM of Tupelo Honey.
I drank a shot of espresso, two Guinness and started walking back
west. I went to Wedge for an AOB stout and realized very suddenly
that I wanted to be Kenny for Halloween, so I texted everybody I
knew asking if they had an orange pair of pants.

I walked up the hill, had a halfpour of a sour from Cellarest,
almost passed by The Walk, but changed my mind, walked inside and
sat next to Will, who bought me a Guinness. He introduced me to 
his friend Albert, who did indeed have an orange pair of pants at
his house and was walking home presently. I joined him and bought
him a beer at the Brew Pump before walking to his house. He had a
very old very protective chocolate lab who did befriend me until
I stood up to leave.

I started walking east in a spooky mist, rather drunkenly, I might
add. I crashed into the Brew Pump and said who knows what, didn't
even buy a beer. I walked home just before nightfall, made Erica
watch some of the Sierra Nevada set, and then made a very good
meal: garbonzo beans w/ tomato and avacado. It was hot as shit
though and I definitely burnt most of my mouth. I didn't have
the easiest time falling asleep after that, but I was very content
to be in my bed. I thought about many times when that wasn't so
easy to come by.

	-X.XXXI-

I lazed in bed all morning, somewhat reluctant thinking about all
the partying to be done. At around 4:00, I got in costume and
walked to the Brew Pump. I realized on the walk there that the
hankie I was using to protect my nose could be stuffed into my
mouth, rendering my speech unintelligable. I ate a burrito while
the party was percolating and started doing long laps once it was
packed.

The Homegrown crew arrived right after things had shut down, and
I was in just the right state to ask if I could tag along with
them. I even said to Justin, "You can't be mad at *me* for giving
you a thumbs down right? We're, good, right?" He said sure and I
gave him a hug. We walked to Country Club, but it was too packed,
so we walked to Cait's house for supplies and cars, then drove to
Dane's where he built a fire and invited more people over. I had
found weed, a one-hitter and a lighter in the pocket of my Carhartt
vest earlier and took that to mean I would run into Cait, so I was
stoked that I could return her one-hitter.

The party eventually dispersed and Lucy agreed that I could come
hang out with her. We drank Four Roses until I took a nap on her
bare bed.

	-XI.I-

I was woken up to an alcoholic Topo-Chico and a breakfast of 
bread and eggs. We drank coffee, went to Ingles for beer,
champagne, pizza, coffee and ginger, and then hung out in the
yard listening to music and drinking as usual. I was a little
surprised when she said it was time to take me home. I think
I had known that was happening, but let it slip my drunken mind.

I had her drop me off at the Brew Pump instead of home. I paid
for some beers (three) that I had walked out on the night before,
drank at least two more (one courtesty of Will) and bought a new
T-shirt. I do not remember walking home at all.

	-XI.II-

Oof: pain, regret, pitty. I made a pot of coffee with random
stuff from upstairs and drank it despite the pain in my stomache.
Around 2:00, I packed my drums into Erica's truck, drove them
down to Kevin's, took the truck home, walked to the Market for
two plums, then walked down to Kevin's and sat in the yard
waiting for him to get done with rehearsal at Scott's. We drove
to Saluda, loaded in, sound checked, ordered food and were
escorted to the new apartment green room where I ate bolognase
and laid quietly knowing full well my mom was in the restaurant.

We walked down, said hello, played a fun 90-minute set, said
goodbye, packed up, loaded out and drove home. I can't believe
I was able to muster any joy at all, especially when my mom, as
usual, was looking like the grumpiest/most bored audience member.
I smoked a bowl with Erica and fell asleep to dream lots of dreams.

	-XI.III-

I don't remember much of said dreams, but I was so happy to be laying
in bed at 9AM with no hangover. Around 10AM, I got up, got dressed
and walked up to the market for coffee, a can of soup, Topo-Chico and 
a plum. I walked home, made coffee, drank a cup with Erica, made 
another, came upstairs, wrote in my journal and watched the new
Beatles music video.

. . .

I made my bed, cleaned my room, heated up the soup, layered up and
went to Morris, to Dan's nextdoor neighbor, Crawford's house for
a quick rehearsal of tunes. Crawford offered me some tablas so I
sat on the floor and played those. I walked home at 3:35 and
arrived at the same time as Fursty. We loaded up my drums and
drove to Downtown Mars Hill where we played a three-hour gig
with Jackson and had beers from the cool little theater before 
the set and on our break.

We drove back to the west side after that and each had a porter
and a burger at the Malvern, which was very nostalgic. He drove
me home and helped me load in my drums. I smoked some weed with
Erica in the basement and then came upstairs to get out of my
winter clothes while she got into hers for a trip to either UJ
or Pueblos. After much talk about South Park, I found I wanted
to do nothing. I laid in bed and alternated between closing my
eyes and looking at spiritual content. I never quite made it
into a full-on meditation; there was so much life to think about.
That's exactly when meditation should be used, but I ended up
sitting in bewilderment until I fell asleep.

	-XI.IV-

I awoke around 9 after many intense dreams about a submarine/
cruise ship making constant trips and even getting flooded.
I was very happy to be cozy in my bed, once again not hungover.
I went downstairs, made a cup of coffee, drank it with Erica,
made a second, came upstairs and wrote in my journal.

I took a bath, got dressed, walked to Ingles, bought ramen, 
pineapple, cubed ham and cuties, walked home, sat on the couch
a while, made lunch and wrote in my journal again.

. . .

Crawford picked me up around 245 and we drove to Hickory Nut
Gap to play with Dan. The weather was beautiful and the set
was a surprising success. We were holding on for dear life and
people were into it. We checked out the piglets afterwards
with Crawford's girlfriend Mema and then drove back to the 
west side. I really only had time to load in my drums and put
on more layers before Charlie wanted to have a drink.

I walked up to the Low Down, but it was packed, so we walked to
the Country Club instead and had one at the bar next to a very
drunk Will, who said my recent appearance at the Brew Pump was
the drunkest he'd ever seen me. We rode down to the Double
Crown and had a very fun time amongst most of the people I
know: The Hypos, Dulci, Tawny, Alyse, Leann, Clay White, Steve,
and even Maryclair, who I had met the day before in Mars Hill.
She came up to me in the crowded bar and said, "I thought I'd
see you at this show," and kept going. Charlie knew I was in
love.

I behaved well for the most part, and even was given Maryclair's
number and glass of wine at the end of the night. I started to 
get a little drunk and rambly at that point. I went to the
Country Club for one more and bought a to-go Guinness. I walked
home, surprised that Erica was still awake. I shared my Guinness
with her and smoked a bowl in the basement, but started to realize
I was getting drunk and was afraid of becoming annoying. I went
upstairs, made and ate ramen, laid in bed excitedly for a while
and eventually decided to make another bowl of noodles before
falling asleep.

	-XI.V-

I woke around 7 only slightly hungover. I was happy to be in
bed but could not go back to sleep. I ate a few clementines
and went downstairs to make coffee once I heard Erica was awake.
I drank two cups down there with her and sat in the hammock. It
was a surprisingly warm day. I texted Maryclair saying it was
nice to see her and I would love to do it on purpose. I went
upstairs and laid in bed for a long time. She eventually texted
back and said, "Yeah let's hang!" I went downstairs for another
coffee & hammock and was surprised when I came back upstairs
that she had suggested a stroll. I brushed my teeth and wrote
in my journal.

. . .

At 4:00, I walked up to The Odd, but they were having a private
event, so I walked down to The Malvern and had a burger+Coke
with way too many french fries. I went to rehearsal at Middlemont
after that, where we ran through songs as a Menage, Moon & You
superband: Natch Woman, Rat King, Harvest Moon, Don't Have Time,
Valerie and Dreams. Ryan gave me a ride home after that, and I
contentedly laid in bed, scrolled on my phone and ate clementines.

	-XI.VI-

I woke at 9:30, went downstairs, made coffee, drank a cup with
Erica, made another, came upstairs, played chess, scrolled on
my phone and wrote in my journal.

. . . 

I walked to Aldi, bought some turkey, mini bagels, plums, citrus,
and came back home, made some lunch, two bagel sandwiches. I walked
down to Middlemont at 5:30 and rehearsed for a while with Ryan,
Melissa and Max. I walked up to the Brew Pump where Sunny was
having her birthday/another going away party. It was kinda sleezy
and Leo was annoying the shit out of me. I had one beer and went
home to bed.

	-XI.VII-

I woke and walked though the Brother Hug Trail to Dulci's Airbnb
where she was making breakfast with Ethan. Kevin showed up and
we eventually went to Sidehouse studios, where Booty Band was
wrapping up a rehearsal. We loaded in gear, set up, got tones
and recorded drums/bass on Take It Easy, then More Than You Can Take.
We ate pizza between songs and called it quits around 9:00. I was
dead tired, came home and went to bed.

	-XI.VIII-

Woke and walked to Dulci's Airbnb, had coffee with she and Ethan,
rode to the studio and tracked drums for Get Out Of My Head. We
did a little percussion, and then, when Kevin showed up, tracked
bass. Ethan started tracking acoustic guitar on everything after
that. Charlie showed up and anxiously listened for a while. We
were also joined by Melissa and Max. When Fursty showed up around
230, we tracked guitar on Out of My Head. Dan soon had to leave,
so we set up for vocals/keyboards. We recorded Dulci vocals for
all three tunes, switched back to electric guitar, and then
recorded Wurlitzer and Organ on everything.

We wrapped around 1:30 in the morning. Kev dropped me off at the
Country Club at 1:55, where I had a Dominga and a to-go Guinness.
I walked home, drank my beer in bed and looked at my phone before
falling fast asleep.

	-XI.IX-

I woke at nine, made a cup of coffee  and walked down to 
Middlemont. It was already a gorgeous day, and I stripped down 
to just my T-shirt. I helped Ryan move drums from the Fit to
the van, walked up to Izzy's, and then went back home for a bath
and a hair washing. I sat in the backyard and brushed/dried my
hair, drank a third cup of coffee, went upstairs, picked out my
stage outfit and wrote in my journal.

. . .

At 1:30, I walked down to Middlemont where we had a very lazy
rehearsal with Tina. We played four songs with Max in the middle.
I laid in the hammock for a while after that. At 4, Ryan's parents
showed up to take care of Max while Ryan, Melissa and I got in the
van. I drove us to the Purple Onion where we loaded in and sound
checked. Ryan and I went to the green room for a while, and then
ate our fish on the patio.

I sat at the back of the room while Menage played some not-very-
feminist songs, played a fun set with The Moon And You, and then
a combined four or five tunes. We loaded the van again and went
home. I was tired.

	-XI.X-

Ryan picked me up at 9AM after thinking he could quickly call in
a biscuit or two from Sunny Point. We waited downtown by Aren's
house for Melissa, who picked us up with shots of espresso and a
biscuit. Ryan drove us frantically down to WNCW with Max in the
back, and we played Sound and Color, Soul Child, Golden Highway
+ Beautiful Mess as Tina and Her Pony. Kim was there to watch
Max, had ridden down with Tina and called me her Walmart Greeter.

Ryan rode with Tina and his mom to do a whole bunch of stuff
while I drove Melissa, Max and I in the van. We got 20 miles 
away before I realized that I had left my raincoat with my jar
of weed in the studio, so I turned around and grabbed it while
Melissa and Max napped. I dropped myself off at B&B Pharmacy,
peed at The Walk, got an Americano from Battle Cat and walked
to Asheville Club where Sierra cutely gave me a Guinness.

I walked to Itto, ate some ramen, then walked down to Lazoom
Room where Dulci was sitting in her car. We smoked a bowl and
talked about our days until Melissa arrived, about the same 
time as the bus. We loaded our gear onboard and rode around
with Vadid and Matt. Highland was having Cold Mountain, so
instead of going there, we went to New Origin, who served
Vadid and I some very tasty seltzers. I chatted with Cam at
New Belgium while drinking a La Folie, and then drank a stout
at Wedge with Vadid and Matt.

We unloaded the bus and I decided to walk up to Imperial, where
Mad Mike was spinning to meet Cam. We hung out on the street for
a while with Keon and Cam's girlfriend, and then went to Double
Crown under my encouragement. I had had two sours served to me
by Gatlin inside and was ready to be back west. Double Crown
was out of Guinness, so I drank a Gin and Tonic and then walked
to Tastee Diner for that Guinness and a talk with the bartender,
about Ryan Lassiter mostly.

I walked to Country Club for one last Dominga and was sat next
to by Taylor. I forgot to mention she had messaged me at 7:15AM
saying, "Wyd," and then, "Do you wanna fuck or not? It's now or
Never." Anyway, she forgave me for being weird and said we could
be friends. She was heading down to Double Crown. I walked home,
listened to the three Dulci mixes, and then watched a little
YouTube. I also made some ramen.

	-XI.XI-

Since the Tina Story Parlor show had been cancelled, I woke with
nothing to do, but it was cold. I was out of fruit and slightly
hungover. After Erica had left to teach her tango class, I
remembered I was owed a free pizza from Dominos, and it occoured
to me I could get a two-litre of Sprite with that, so I did, an
Italian sausage and pineapple pizza, the worst cut I've ever seen
in my life. I ate some of that, drank sprite, made coffee, smoked
weed and scrolled on my phone, mostly watching Pomplamoose videos,
and then wrote in my journal.

	-XI.XII-

I woke at 9, went down to Middlemont to collect my drums, ordered
an Americano from Izzy's, came home, drank my coffee with Erica,
made another, listened to some flute music, came upstairs and
wrote in my journal.

. . . 

Bridger picked me up after noon, and we rode to the country,
Miranda's house, where we recorded drums on a song of hers.
Her land, her dog, her cats, her presence, and especially her
songs were so beautiful. I rode home with Bridger, got two
porters and some Indian food at the Brew Pump, came home, saw
a post on Instagram about World of Warcraft Classic Hardcore,
installed it, was playing within minutes, created a druid,
got stoned, ran around with someone randomly up to level
7, died and went to bed.

	-XI.XIII-

I woke at 8:30, made coffee and played some WoW. I made another
coffee and played until noon, reaching level six. I walked downtown, went to
the bank, had a Guinness at the Asheville Club and walked back
to the west side. Lucy called me while I was outside of Battle
Cat. I had just told her about Scott confirming our December 1st
show at Eulogy. Apparently Cait had been too hungover to attend
Chuck's birthday even though she was supposed to bring the cake,
and everyone was upset because they really wanted to invite me
anyway.

I forgot to mention how Taylor had been circling me with her car
in the church parking lot, drunkenly hinting that she wanted to
hang out again. Anyway, after Battle Cat, I went into Ingles,
bought soy sauce, grape juice, pineapple slices, clementines
and arugala. I went home and Erica said, "I didn't expect you
back so soon." I said, "I'm too excited to play Warcraft," which
is what I did. I played from 3:30 til midnight, reaching level 12.
I laid in bed to see if I was sleepy and only had the strength
to purchase my new talents, Regrowth and the bear roar that
reduces nearby stats.

	-XI.XIV-

I woke, went downstairs and made a coffee. After drinking half
a cup, I got excited to play WoW, so I went upstairs and realized
it is a maintenance day. I made another cup, cleaned off my desk,
booted up the iMac and wrote in my journal. I would really like
to play WoW on said iMac, so I'm wondering if running OS X off a
speedy USB stick would get the job done.

. . .

I had a keyboard order to fulfill, and when I tried installing the
drivers for my label printer, I corrupted the whole operating system,
so I walked to the post office and mailed it the old fashoned way. I
went to Aldi after that and bought plums, clementines, turkey and ramen.
I walked home and played WoW until 6:30, when Charlie and Dulci came over
to discuss/rehearse. I played WoW until 2AM after that.

	-XI.XV-

 I woke and played WoW until I heard a cough from Erica, and then went
 downstairs to make coffee. I played for most of the day and excitedly
 went to Ingles at one point. I resumed playing after that until Brody
 came over and started futzing with the electricity. After he left, I
 got about 2 more hours in, hit level 19 and went to sleep at 2AM.

 	-XI.XVI-

  I woke, made coffee, drank it downstairs, made another, came upstairs
  and did a few quests, including starting my aquatic quest three levels
  too late. I was snooping around for half of the Silverpine medallion when
  I found an island full of Merlocks. I noticed they were the same level as
  me, so I figured I would kill some for fun. I got ganked on the first pull,
  used a potion and barely survived. When I noticed there was an herb nearby,
  I got extra greedy. I decided I would hang on the island and clear out
  murlocks for a while, but foolishly started my second pull before my potion
  cooldown was up. I got ganked again, and, with nowhere to run, died rather
  unavoidably. Even if I had had a potion available, I don't think I would have
  been able to swim out of range or fight them both off. I was level 19.

  I was surprisingly accepting, perhaps even less annoyed than if I had died on
  a normal server. I sat in the hammock, took a bath, sat in the hammock again,
  reflected and came upstairs to write in my journal. I'm going to start another
  Tauren druid and I'm excited about it. I will probably change up my talent tree
  but maintain the same professions, and think extra hard about my keybindings
  and how to best use QMK.

. . .

I started another druid and got to level 4 before Brody arrived and started futzing
again. At 3PM, I walked down to Kevin's house. We hopped in the car and drove to
Reflections on the Pond, right by Dulci's house in Canton. We played a very swanky
fundraiser for KARE that was surprisingly bearable. I was wearing my fake glasses I
had found from Charleston while looking for a black tie. We stopped by Dulci's house
after the gig to pick up some brown bags and then drove back to West Asheville where
I smoked weed with Erica and played WoW until I was level 9, going to bed around 2:30.

	-XI.XVII-

I woke at 830, drank some juice, went downstairs, made a coffee, drank it with Erica,
made another, came upstairs and played WoW for about half an hour before the server
shut down for maintenance. I managed to make a bank alt right before that happened and
then wrote in my journal.

. . .

I went to Kev's at 3:30 and recorded percussion on More Than You Can Take, Take It Easy
and Get Out of My Head. I chatted with Dulci as she arrived, and then went home to WoW.

	-XI.XVIII-

I woke up early, played WoW, walked down to Middlemont at 11 for TMAY+Dulci rehearsal
and then walked to Aldi for plums, citrus, bananas and turkey. I played WoW from 4 til
bed.

	-XI.XIX-

I woke up early and played WoW until I hit level 20 right before Ryan, Melissa and Max
picked me up. Ryan drove us half off the road to Sierra Nevada, almost missing every
exit. We played three mid sets there with lots of family present and then skiddaddled
around 6PM. I drank two NA beers and drove us home, at which point I played WoW, from
7 til bed.

	-XI.XX-

I slept in a little later than usual, drank two cups of coffee and then started questing.
At 2:20, I drove up to Ingles for peas, arugula, citrus and yogurt for Erica. I came home,
got back to WoW, and made it to level 26 before going to bed at 1AM. I had almost died at
least twice.

	-XI.XXI-

I woke up around 10AM to a rainy day, went downstairs, made two cup of coffee, came upstairs,
sat down to play some WoW and realized they were having server maintenance, so I wrote in my
journal while drinking my second cup of coffee. 

. . .

I drove to Tina practice and then straight home to play WoW all night, mostly grinding, and
reached level 28 before deciding to go to bed at midnight.

	-XI.XXII-

I woke early, went downstairs and made a cup of coffee, drank it with Erica, made a second
and came upstairs to grind some more. I reached level 29, found some new quests in Thousand
Needles, and then died trying to escape some water elementals. I decided to rearrange all my
desks after that, moving the iMac back over to the big table, and setting up a WoW station
on the glass desk with my old monitor. I played a little bit of a new druid once everything
was all set up, made it to level six and decided to take a break to set up SSH keys and write
in my journal.
