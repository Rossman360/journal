III.VII.XXIV

GitHub indicates that my last journal entry was four months ago, November 22nd. I was playing Hardcore WoW, which means I spent the winter leveling one-and-a-half WoW toons, making a record with Scott McMicken, eating lots of noodles and making efforts to cut back on drinking.
   Last Saturday, I stopped by the Brew Pump on my way to the Ether Jam and ordered a beer out of habit. I stared at it with regret, wondering what it could possibly do for me apart from lead to more drinking. We had an incredible jam that night.
   Some of my reconsiderings had begun from conversations I'd recently had with Hannah after confessing that it seemed like we like each other. Her initial "conclusion" was that we are too different, partly because of my relationship with substances.
   We have gone back and forth from being on the same page to not. My love for her still grows. Thankfully, we have both already made the mistake of convincing someone to love us. She has promised to smash me over the head with her love if she finds it.

I have been listening to music for pleasure and have even signed up for ad-free Spotify to satiate my appetite. This is the result of an even split between being inspired by the Scott album, having time to heal from Holy Ghost and not sacrificing my personal enjoyments for the sake of a partner for the first time in ~12 years.

The ultimate paradigm shift that led me to purchase this journal and pen was the realization of my dream life, walking around and encountering people could be executed beyond my wildest dreams without the excuse of beer prohibiting me from how long I can "be in the field."

On Sunday, I saw Cait while drinking a coffee at the Brew Pump. She asked if I was sober in a shocked manner. I realized she hadn't changed at all in ten months, which contextualized how much I had.
   Monday, I walked downtown, craved a beer, had a coffee instead, went to Altamont Deli, ordered a cheese steak, ran into Matt Shepard, had a picnic with him, walked back to the west side, met Old Sap at the Brew Pump, went home, took a bath, got invited to the Mashup by Lucy, had a great time, then went to Double Crown, Fleetwood's, the Country Club and home.
   Zero beers were had, but I still felt pleasantly rocked when I got home. I listened to music and ate a box of Cheez-Its.
   Tuesday I voted, hung with Francis and fell asleep at 7PM. Wednesday I was lazy until our trio shed hang where we recorded Bobby.

Today, I woke up, craved a walk downtown and realized there was no such thing as too early if no alcohol came into play. I got a coffee from AVL Club, drank it in three locations, walked into the library, couldn't find a book, looked out the window, saw Staples and remembered how I had bought a journal there before.
   I decided it was time, so I did that, came back to the library, sat in the same spot and wrote.

I've also been thinking about how any invitation ever from my dad to hang out always specifically includes beer. 
 
. . .

I got a cold brew from AVL Club, texted a couple people outside of Little Bee, popped into Harvest, bought a copy of Shabang, talked to Mark, who is in a band opening for Hypos at Eulogy, walked into Revolve, chatted with Emily for a minute, ate some lamburgers at Botiwalla, came home, listened to Guero and texted people about band things. I then walked to Aldi, stopping before and after at UJ to hang with Erica and Taylor, which led to seeing Francis and JB as well.
   The sun started going down, so Erica and I walked home, where I wrote in my journal after putting my groceries away: peas, Cheez-Its, clementines and bananas.

. . .

I walked downtown, stopping briefly at the Country Club and Morgan's Comics. Rachel's loops were mesmerizing. I sat with Old Sap and his wife Leah (?) until set break, at which point I signed up to buy Rachel's upcoming vinyl.
   I walked back to the west side, stopping briefly at the Double Crown for a Squirrel Nut Zippers-esque band, went to Ingles for Cheetos, grape juice & Sprite, then hung at the Country Club a bit before walking home, getting into my pajamas and writing in my journal. It was good to talk to Taylor Martin for a few. 

III.VIII

I woke at 9:30 and consumed way too much content on my phone. Eventually, I went downstairs, made a cup-and-a-half of coffee, talked to Erica for a few minutes, came up to my room and looked at my phone some more.
   Allison Etzel posted a story of a peeled clementine saying she had just recreated a dating profile, which she has always hated doing, so if anyone wants to ask her out, now is their chance. I asked if she'd like to go on a date sometime, and then specifically suggested the Hypos show.

I listened to Bobby, watched the Okonski Secret Sounds, which segued into a Dr. Dog live concert. I decided I was definitely in the mood for that, but after a couple songs, I decided I didn't need video, so I put their Live in San Fran album on and have been listening to it while writing in my journal.
   Just as it was getting really exciting, they started playing Easy Beat and brought Pat on stage, who got sappy for a second, something I don't even remember from Brian's funeral. I can't believe I just called him that.

Things got lazy and less blatantly sacred after that. I ate Cheez-Its, ramen w/ peas and listened to some more Dr. Dog.

. . .

I walked to Izzy's, enjoyed a coffee on their porch and then walked down to Kevin's house where we had a fun and relaxed evening going through tunes we'd like to eventually cover for a divas show. To Dulci's surprise, I walked home in the rain, ate the rest of my Cheetos and fell asleep.

III.IX

Woke to pre-9AM texts from Tina, made coffee, looked at my phone a bit, learned Ryan has COVID, agreed to hopefully rock anyway and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I loaded drums into the truck, set them up, drove home, made peas n' noodles, packed my bag, walked to Battle Cat, drank two coffees, ran through the set with Kevin and wrote in my journal.

. . .

We played a beautiful set. At some point, I decided my next drink is locked inside Darwin's time capsule. Tina gave me a ride home, where I got undressed, laid in bed and texted with Hannah a bit before falling asleep.

III.X

I woke at the new eleven, got dressed and collected my drums from Story Parlor. I came home, made a cup of coffee and did my best to ride the line of inviting Hannah to the Hypos show vs seeing if I would see her there. Her response leaned slightly toward the latter.
   I ate a banana, made a second cup of coffee, listened to Michael Kiwanuka and then the Ever-Expanding record while writing in my journal.
   It is dawning on me now that the record could possibly be eponymous.

I listened to some Michael Nau, took a bath, made some pea noodles, played some phone chess with JB and wrote in my journal while contemplating a third cup of coffee.

. . .

I rode with Kev to the shed where we worked on Endlessly the Spirit, All the Way, Coulda Shoulda Woulda, Bobby, Dancefloor and When You're Easy. We also walked around and took some band photos. At one point, I almost exclaimed, "This is just the best," but I kept it to myself.
   Kevin and I rode home mostly in silence until I decided to mention my date with Allison. I went quickly to bed, only taking my clothes off one at a time when they started to bother me. 

III.XI

I woke and laid in bed until I heard Erica leaving, at which point I made a coffee and listened to our songs from the night before--six of 'em! I've done little else apart from making my bed and cleaning my room and writing in my journal. Oh man, I forgot about Paranoid. That makes seven songs!

. . .

I decided to walk downtown but was hollered at by Piper, so we ate lunch at Tastee Diner. I walked home after that, put my sandwich in the fridge and walked to Aldi for grapes and citrus before swinging by the Brew Pump and drinking four cups of coffee.
   I walked home as the sun started to go down to put on my nighttime clothes and write in my journal.

. . .

Erica followed me up to Different World for a drink and seemed surprised that I left without having one. The show had not yet started and it was very quiet.
   I walked up to One World and posted up while the Mashup sound checked and the room filled in. At 9:20, I walked back to Different World and watched Slow Packer while sort of standing next to Hannah. She seemed unhappy, which made me realize that's how she often seems.
   She went home for sleep, so I walked back to One World. Barbie told me Justin was basically refusing to leave Cait's house, which was unsurprising apart from me figuring that had already played out.
   I drove Lucy & I up to Double Crown, but they were closed, so we went to Waffle House and then Lucy House. We promptly got in bed and watched Ricky Stanicky. I dreamt I was in Roller Coaster Tycoon with Allison Etzel looking for secrets.

III.XII

I woke, drank tons of coffee and watched Lucy try to organize her life. She eventually drove me home, where I made some peas n' noodles; I packed my bag, walked to the Pump, arrived at 3:00 on the nose, ate my food and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I felt very tired at 3:45, so I walked home, ate some fruit and laid down for a while. I went back to the Pump and hung out until sundown, at which point I went back home, took a bath, ate some food, talked to Erica and was in bed by 11.

III.XIII

I woke around ten, got dressed and walked straight to the Asheville Club, where I drank an Americano. They were trying to fix the Guinness tap, and Sal brought me a foaming pint so that I may assess its quality, which I declined. "I can't," I said, "I quit."
   I got a second Americano and drank it in Bartel Pritchard, where three App kids asked if they could pray for me. Bless their hearts, they sure tried. Allison said she wanted to get dinner at Botiwalla, so I started heading back west.
   But, she was confused and thought Botiwalla was downtown. She said she had a Burial gift card though, so we decided we would eat there. I ran into Myles on my way home, changed shoes, packed my bag and walked up to the Brew Pump where I drank a coffee and wrote in my journal.
   I got a second cup, smoked some pot and rode that wave before walking across the street and buying some arugula alternative. I walked home, made a bagel sandwich and wrote in my journal, still very high.

. . .

I walked to Country Club, drank a soda water w/ Dave, started walking downtown, hung on the stoop w/ Fletcher and Mikey, went to Burial, sat with the band until Allison showed up, ate with her, went to the concert, made plans to Eat Botiwalla with Allison soon, caught a ride to the Country Club, drank a soda water w/ Cait, walked home, ate some grapes and wrote in my journal.

III.XIV

I woke at 8, drank two cups of coffee, walked to Aldi, made noodles n' peas and came dangerously close to taking a nap before writing in my journal.
   I went to the Brew Pump, then Kevin's house to let Charlie out. Then, I met Juan at the Pump and played two games of Splendor before walking home, taking a bath and going straight to bed with my window cracked.

III.XV

I slept so hard thanks to the rain and thunder, and only getting four hours the night before. I dreamt that I was offered a glass of champagne while at a party w/ Scott & Leann--among many other dreams--and drank it out of sheer forgetfulness, which was very upsetting.
   It was nearly 1130 when I woke to notifications about unpaid bills, phone & Shopify, chess w/ JB, concert notifications and the 1,000th Wordle, that I decided to cheat on. I went downstairs, made a coffee, came back to my bed and wrote in my journal.
   My heart was feeling heavy so I decided to take a walk. By the time I made it to Battle Cat, I knew I had something to say to Allison, that my heart was partly tied to someone who wants to remain friends and so whatever she and I want to explore will have to be careful and casual.
   I was outside of the Grey Eagle when she texted me back saying she was in a similar situation and was relieved to know I wasn't looking for exclusive on the quick.
   I walked to the Asheville Club, got a coffee and Sierra's number, chatted with Edwin on the street, who understood exactly what I was up to musically and how much it meant, got a latte and walked to the Country Club where I chatted with Jessie, Juliette and met John. I came home, ate a banana, brushed my teeth and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I went to Botiwalla, had dinner with Allison and walked to the Brew Pump, but they were closed. I ran into Allen in the parking lot and we decided to go to UJ, where Francis was sitting at the bar. After chatting with him, I walked home, made my bed and wrote in my journal.

III.XVI

Again I stayed up late and woke up early; Erica was having a gout attack. I made a coffee before 8am, walked downtown to AVL club, ordered one, saw Kari Gunn outside of Bartel Pritchard. I ordered another, drank some in the bar and walked to the west side, stopping to pee at Archetype.
   I talked to my mom while I walked to Odd's, where I sat on the back porch and listened to music. Retrocade's tunes got too loud when they opened their garage door, so I went and sat on the pile of lumber at the top of Sand Hill.
   I walked down to Middlemont, running into Courtney & Lindsey on the way, who were racking mountain bikes on the back of their van. I ran through 11 tunes w/ Ryan, Melissa and Max including a coffee break, #4, with Ryan.
   I played them Back in the Water and walked up to Diatribe where I went 2-1 in chess with Charlie and drank an Athletic IPA. I walked home, made peas & noodles, ate a bunch of fruit, changed into my Rainbows and walked up to the Brew Pump. I ate my food, smoked a bowl, drank some Cheerwine, sat next to Dr. Myles and wrote in my journal.

. . .

Lucy was wanting to get into something, so I told her about the Orange Moon/orange soda release party, and she wanted to go, so I walked home, changed shoes and dropped off my bag before walking back to the Brew Pump and hopping in the car with her.
   We went to the Mule where the music was good and the soda delicious, but the vibe (expectedly) awkward. I was kinda surprised to see J Lloyd in the band, but he of course crushed it playing mostly percussion. Lucy talked to his girlfriend Hannah a lot and, eventually, so did I. She was thrilled for me to overshare the details of my relationship with Lucy and responded similarly. Juan sat in on a couple tunes and seemed a mess but sounded good.
   We went to One Stop after that and I made Lucy buy me two slices of pizza. It took a long while for the band to get started, but, once they did, I recognized the guitar player from another life. I said to Hunter McBride on their set break, "This is a far cry from The Family," thinking it would blow his mind for someone there to remember that band, but he just said, "Yeah, that's why I started playing synth in that band." I said, "It's me, Ross from Holy Ghost," and he said, "Yeah, I know!"
   I walked to the Country Club, drank a soda water, went home and fell asleep.

III.XVII

I woke and legitimately thought J. Lloyd, Hannah & Lucy had started a funk band, but couldn’t figure out when I would have seen them. I felt kinda hungover.
   I drank coffee, played Wordle, texted w/ Hannah, drove my mom to the airport, came home, made peas n’ noodles, cleaned a little and drove to High-Five on the river.
   It was blustery, but I had two delicious coffees and a nice chat w/ Hannah. I drove to Aldi & Ingles after that, came home and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I took a bath, made my bed, moved the lamp, read, looked at Instagram, listened to two Dream Theater songs, tried to meditate, read, looked at my phone, read, talked to Hannah and wrote in my journal.

III.XVIII

I woke around 9, made coffee, looked at my phone, read, ate fruit, made more coffee, moved the Coop so Erica could go to Atlanta, made noodles n’ peas, ate, took a bath and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I set an alarm for 413 without realizing it was AM and settled in for what I thought would be a 30min nap, but I went 20m over and woke in a panic. I was able to recover, but had ridden the nap line dangerously close.
   I went to Goodwill and the Brew Pump before driving down to Hendrix. Practice was a bit annoying — petty and unprofessional feeling, perhaps? I drove to Mashup, hung until intermission, said hey to Tyler Householder, then split.
   I came home, made two bagels, ate a bunch of fruit and wrote in my journal.

III.XIX

I woke to a canceled shed hang and felt very unsure what to do with my day — almost lonely, even. I eventually walked to Aldi for grapes. I stopped in the market and inspected the soups before agreeing to meet Cait at the Brew Pump.
   We hung mostly with Grant for the customary two ciders before she invited me over to smoke the bong. I wanted to move the Mini out of the driveway, so we went to my house for a few minutes first.
   We decided to catch the last bits of equinox sun at New Belgium. Actually, first, we had lunch. We shared a GF veg sandwich Cait had grabbed from the market, a salad from Homegrown and a grilled cheese.
   After NB and smoking another bong, we went to Ryan’s house and played Rummy, smoking cigarettes in the cold before each hand. Cait invited me in when I drove her home. She went upstairs to smoke a dab with her roommate, had a small fashion show in the hallway and then announced she was going to bed.
   I drove home and almost let her know I would be interested in having sex with her, but I decided to save it for a time when she wasn’t on dabs, Adderall, blow & eight ciders.

III.XX

I woke, made coffee, made my bed, ate fruit and wrote in my journal.
   I left the house, got a coffee from Battle Cat, walked to the AVL Club, got another, sat in Bartel Pritchard, and then walked to Loretta's. I sat in the window and looked at the menu til Fursty came in behind me.
   We chatted until I decided I didn’t want to eat yet and he had to get back to work. I decided to see if the market on Wall Street had NA Guinness and ran into Eden right outside, who was going to a job interview. I was excited to tell her I had quit drinking. She has been thinking of doing the same.
   I peed at the Grey Schmeagle, said hi to Jess and walked to the Whale, where the bartender was even more excited than me to have NA Guinness. I sat in the sun, sipped excitedly on it and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I walked home, loaded my drums into the Mini Cooper and made a mason jar of peas n’ noodles. I drove to the Brew Pump and ate them with a cup of Starry. There was no one hanging out there, so I decided I would loiter at the Getaway instead.
   I forgot what an old drunk biker bar it really was, and so I really felt like a character drinking coffee and Athletic with my long hair and David Sedaris book. I was probably there for three hours before frantic Ryan showed up.
   The radio sound people were literal opposites of the gruff bikers, and I longed for an energy somewhere in the middle, which is where Hannah came in. As we played, I watched her go from grumpy to tipsy on cherry cider, from dissociated to pool shark.
   I forgot to mention how the owner of the market took a liking to me, randomly saw me wasting time at the bar and showed up later hoping I would be his friend. The whole bar cleared out except for me, him and Hannah.
   I drove home, made bagels and texted Hannah a bit before falling into a deep sleep. We were both feeling grumpy/cranky about transitions in our lives, but I told her we got this.
   “Night night,” we said.

III.XXI

I had a marathon of dreams complete with all the characters of my life, and all more realistic than the Getaway had been. I woke at 1030, brushed my teeth, got dressed and bee-lined for the AVL Club, where Dennis was working his last shift.
   I drank a coffee in Bartel Pritchard, meditated and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I ordered one more coffee and drank it in front of the library, where I talked to two nearly incoherent zen masters, then meditated. I recommended Lucy park in Montford and took a pee at All Day Darling.
   We walked to the Grey Schmeagle, where the cook failed at making coffee, knowing what cava was, how to pour a beer. We walked to Taco Billy, where Lucy drank a mimosa.
   We sat on the hill, and when Lucy went to talk to people she knew, I meditated, and then wrote a sentence in my journal. We walked to the crazy gas station by Harvest Records, where Lucy got a bag of hot Takis and a single-serve box of Bota.
   We walked to my house where I made bagels, listened to the new Dr. Dog song. We sat on the porch for a while, and — no, first I took Lucy to her car. I wrote in my journal on the porch while she went to the liquor store.
   After that is when she vented on the porch. We watched Deadpool and I got a little horny. But by the time the movie was over, she was drunk and breaking things. I should have offered to drive her home, but the thought was too much. She drove herself. I made plain noodles and wrote in my journal.
   She just texted me saying she’s home safe. I’m halfway tempted to walk around a 24-hour Ingles, but I don’t know what I would buy.

III.XXII

I woke after 10, went downstairs, made a coffee, talked with Erica. I mentioned how I thought my dad might be disappointed that I had quit drinking, and she said, “You quit drinking??”
   I made another coffee, came up stairs and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I spent way too long figuring out how to set the Mini audio to aux, and then drove to Sylva (in like 40m) Pops (as I just started calling him) and I hung out for a bit, then went to Innovation + Cosmic Carryout.
   When I told him what an Athletic was, he said, “Oh, cuz you’re driving Mom’s car.” I said, “Yeah, sorta. I also quit drinking three weeks ago.” He said, “For good? Oh… that’s good, I guess.”
   I had a kombucha and took some to go. I cleaned my coffeemaker and headed out, stopping at Lucy's on the way back for a couple nuggies. I told — or implied to Allison that I was in the neighborhood, but she extended no invitation, so I drove home, gave Erica a ride to B&B, came back home and wrote in my journal. Id asked Hannah what she was up to and she sent a cute pic of her hanging with family out of town, so I got high.

. . .

I made peas n’ noodles, grabbed my drum rug out of the car, set it up in my room and sat on the floor. At some point, I stumbled upon Brian Blade’s website and felt inspired to revamp my own, which I did while listening to his latest album. I also listened to Khruangbin, the new Dr. Dog song and wrote in my journal.
   Erica reclaimed her Bluetooth speaker but suddenly remembered she had an old pair + amp in the basement, so I gladly set those up and test them out with some Cake.

III.XXIII

I woke at nine, made coffee and listened to Shabang. I told Kev I thought we could probably fit the keyboard in the Mini, but he said he would probably just drive and maybe even go to Guitar Center beforehand.
   So, I drove downtown, parked at the LaZoom Room and wrote in my journal while listening to Youngblood Brass Band.

. . .

I loaded my drums onto the bus when it arrived. Kevin, Dulci, Charlie and I sound checked for Kyle, but David was hosting. We played Sweet Sweet Baby, What’s Up, Bag of Hammers and Valerie on the way to Highland. We all hung out on the bus once we got there.
   On the way to New Belgium, we played Strawberry Wine, Flowers, Marry You, Debra and surely one other. I ordered a ginger beer from the bar.
   We discussed playing Zombie by The Cranberries but decided it was too topical for the bus, so we were surprised when David asked if we knew it. For the first time, we let a passenger sing a request. We followed it with Tubthumping and then mostly all got coffees at Summit.
   Charlie led us through Margaritaville on the way back downtown, followed by Friends in Low Places, Livin’ on a Prayer and We Are the Champions. Dulci spotted me $10 for a burrito from Mamacita’s, and then we did it all again.
   It was cold now, so I packed my drums, sped to Ingles, bought pretzel shells, grapes and came home where I took a bath, made peas n’ noodles + arugula & pretzel shell crumbles and then wrote in my journal.

. . .

I fell asleep very full with a bag of grapes next to me, waking periodically and eating 2-4 of them with a sip of bubbly water.
   I woke at 530, put on May the Lord Watch, cleaned my room, smoked a bowl and wrote in my journal. I put on a Brian Blade record and slept soundly.

III.XXIV

I woke at 11 to a text from Cait; her tum would probably be unfit for a walk. I pulled Erica's truck further forward and parked the Mini behind it. Then, I packed my drums into their bags, made a coffee and wrote in my journal.

. . .

Cait felt too depressed to take a walk, a feeling which then spread to me. Around 230, I set off for Aldi and bought grapes, citrus, bananas, peas. I texted Cait, “I can give you another chance,” and she replied, “Haha, right on.”
   I sat with Michel, Kari and Maria for a moment at the Brew Pump and then walked home, unpacked my groceries, made a coffee and wrote in my journal. I texted w/ Hannah, walked to the market for toothpaste & chicken noodle soup, ate it at the Brew Pump, came home, looked at my phone and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I was content with my solitude but also worried about Cait. I fell asleep very early, maybe nine?

III.XXV

I woke at nine after lots of dreams with strangers. My three blankets were very heavy. I made a coffee, listened to Magnolia by Okonski and wrote in my journal.
   It was still too cold to go for a walk at eleven, so I made another coffee and put on The Wind Rises.

. . .

It was close to one when I started getting my things together to leave the house. The weather was inviting at first, but the further I walked, the more the wind blew in my face. “The wind rises; you must live.” I stopped into Battle Cat, ordered a latte and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I talked with Jess for a minute and decided I would continue downtown. I walked to the bank, had a coffee at AVL Club, walked to Jack of the Wood, had a NA Guinness, walked back to Battle Cat for a cup of coffee, ordered some veggie dumplings from Lil’ Nick, ate them on my walk home, listened to a Big Fur album, took a bath, made peas n’ noodles and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I looked at my phone for a while, listened to some 311 and walked up to the Mashup. I snuck in the back and ordered a kombucha and a sparkling lemonade.
   I drove Cait’s car toward country karaoke, but saw Lucy walking outside of Weirdo Central and parked the car. She hollered to see if we needed anything and I said, “Rap Snacks!”
   we hung at karaoke until 230. then, Lucy bought three hot dogs and we went to Cait’s house where we listened to music and played charades until 430. I walked home in the mist, ate some fruit and wrote in my journal.

III.XXVI

Woke to a rainy day, listened to May the Lord Watch, drank coffee, ate fruit and pretzel shells, listened to Kokoroko, fell asleep, woke, made coffee, updated my calendar, listened to Madvillany and wrote in my journal.
   I made noodles n’ peas w/ pretzel crumbles, looked at my phone and listened to Shintaro Sakamoto. Then, Spotify recommended I listen to Illinoise — what a long album! I put on the Kokoroko album after that and fell asleep.

III.XXVII

It was a little harder to get up than I expected, so I put a coffee in my to-go cup, brushed my teeth, got dressed, packed my bag and left the house. I walked to AVL Club, ordered another coffee and wrote in my journal.
   I lost a game of chess to Isaiah, ordered another coffee, lost a game to Nate, ordered a latte and walked to the west side. I stopped in the bottle shop, bought a four-pack of GuinNA, walked to the Brew Pump, sat on the stage, listened to the Ever-Expanding album and then wrote in my journal.

. . .

Derek, Travis and I helped Myles complete the Mountain Xpress crossword, and then I made peas n’ noodles, dropped off a bag at Ryan & Melissa’s house, went to Kev's, ate my food on their porch and drove us all to the shed, where we had Ever-Expanding rehearsal as a nine-piece for the first time (and pizza.)
   I dropped Kevin & Alyse off and sped to a show downtown at the One Stop, then had friends over til 6AM.

III.XVIII

I hid in bed, ate pickle chips, drank coffee and an Athletic until about 320, when I moved the Mini, got dressed and laid my rug out in the back of the truck. I also wrote in my journal.

. . .

I drove to Kev's house, smoked a bowl in the front yard and drove to the shed, where we loaded all the gear. Kev and I grabbed coffees on our way to Revolve, where we loaded in the gear, set up and eventually played through the Ever-Expanding record for a small crowd and many cameras.
   We socialized while packing up. I took the truck home, fetched the Mini and spent $30 on a burger, fries and Sprite at the Pub. I watched UNC lose their tournament game and gave my friend Jill a hug. I drove home and fell fast asleep.

III.XXIX

I woke at 8 and looked at Instagram. The sound of the door being locked when we were ready to perform at Revolve was suck in my head. The Nap Ministry shared a link to Beyoncé's cover of Blackbird, so I listened to that whole album and fell right back asleep until 1130.
   I woke, got dressed, brushed & flossed and headed for downtown. I ordered a coffee from AVL Club, did some social media, went over to Bartel Pritchard and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I ordered another coffee,dis some more social media, sat in the park some more, ordered a latte and walked to the west side. I sat in front of Sunny Point for a while and then walked with Hannah to Odd's and back.
   I went home, changed my bag setup and walked to Aldi with a quick stop at the Brew Pump before and after. I went home, took a bath, made noodles & peas, looked at my phone and wrote in my journal.

III.XXX

I woke at seven but fell back asleep for a long time. I drank a cup of coffee, went to Jill's bday at the arcade, drank a coffee at the Pump, went home, made food and then went to the Greagle.
   I forgot to say I had listened to Sara Shook’s new record and cleaned my room while drinking that first coffee. I chatted with Jack while he ate dinner and then walked up to AVL Club for a latte and a sit in the park, where I wrote in my journal.

. . .

I walked back down to Greagle for the Disarmers show, helped with load-out, swung by Weirdo Central w/ Jack and then hung for a while at my house. We listened to Ever-Expanding, Khruangbin, Scary Goldings and a Cavaliers lot session before I drove him downtown.

III.XXXI

Woke, drank two coffees and put gas in the car. I got some soup from the market, ate it under a tree and drove to the coffee shop by the airport where I had a nitro cold brew.
   I picked up my mom and drove her to Sylva, then had a burger and an Athletic w/ Pops. I went back to their house, ate some grapes, laid on the couch for a while and then drove back to Asheville.
   I bought some NA Guinness and took it to the Pump, where we came up with the idea for the Oopsy App. I went home, took a bath and wrote in my journal.

IV.I

I went to Aldi for grapes and bubbles as soon as they opened, then came home, made a coffee and charged my phone. The first Ever-Expanding track was released, so I posted to my story and started walking downtown.
   I got a coffee at AVL Club, did some more social media stuff, went to Bartel Pritchard, opened a GuinNA and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I started walking west, stopping briefly at Aren's house to use the restroom. I went home, made food and looked at my phone on the porch until the sun started to set and I decided another walk was in order.
   I walked down to the Bitter Kitty, turned around, walked up to the Pump and hung w/ Casey, Jackie, Jake & Chad for a few. I decided to check out the Mashup, so walked down there and sat with my back to the wall. Josh came in and we related with each other how we didn’t feel social, but staying home alone didn’t seem an option either.
   I walked to the Country Club, chatted with Kevin & Dave, got a soda water, sat with Tate, Mark and Tawney for a minute, then walked home, listened to Dawn Landes and fell asleep.

IV.II

Woke, tidied up the clothes in my room, made a cup of coffee and drank it in the back garden, finishing it in the hammock. I made some updates to my website, cleaned up around the house a bit more, set up my rug on the porch and sat for a spell. I texted a friend saying it was the most beautiful day of the year for sure.
   I started a load of laundry, almost fell asleep, went back out to the porch and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I went to Cait’s house and exchanged some vinyls. We smoked and went to Zilly for food & cider/NA stout. We weren’t back to her house, one at Romat, where we saw Francis, who was upset. “You two are here.” this was after stopping at my house to get my nighttime clothes.
   We went to Little Jumbo and saw music like none I had ever heard — jazz blues Cajun? I guess I’ve heard that. I didn’t recognize it in the context of Asheville musicians. It transcended in that way.
   We went back to Cait’s house and jammed on instruments no one can play. Will showed up and I got upset. I went home and thought I might wallow for a couple days.

IV.III

I dreamt I was exchanging painting lessons w/ Alan Watts. When I woke, I felt reborn, and the weather was unexpectedly warm, so I set off on foot. I got to the bend in Wayhood and decided to turn back to Cattle Bat for a quad Americano with my last $5.00.
   there was one dry sunny spot on the bench by the entrance, so I enjoyed the best cup of coffee of my life and walked home, where I sat in the back garden, cleaned my bathtub, took a bath, changed over my laundry, sat on my drum rug and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I made some updates to my website while listening to The Listening, folded my laundry, put it away. I listened to some of the first Black Star album and Take Me Where I ain’t.

. . .

I picked up Hannah and we drove to Hillman, where we met Nathan, ordered food and were randomly joined by Ryan and Allison. We walked across the street to Open Folk and were engulfed with music. Millie said, “Y’all wanna hang?” The kitchen was closed across the street, so we went to Standard Pizza and talked about how we can improve our community.

IV.IV

I woke, drank three cups of coffee, did laundry from start to finish, worked on website back end, took a bath, loaded my drums into the car, drove to Kev's for a bit and then down to the Purple Onion, where I set up my drums, sound checked, drank an Athletic, ate dinner, ordered a coffee, went to the greenroom and wrote in my journal.

. . .

Kevin, Dulci and I played a very fun set. From what I can gather looking at my calendar, it was the first time we’d played our original songs together since the Pie Chani Christmas party in early December. The music felt fresh and effortless.
   I drank a coffee while loading out and then got stuck in traffic.

IV.V

I woke, made coffee and listened to the new Khruangbin album before packing a small bag to go house sitting. I stared out the window when I got there, sitting quietly with Charlie and Nubs. My phone informed me that I had walked 122 miles in the month of March — certainly a new record.

. . .

Gnarlie and I went to the bank after reading through writings and making small changes. I deposited my cash from the Purple Onion and said, “Could a depressed person do that?” it was very windy outside. We drove home, ate some food & took a nap together.
   I spent the night on self-enquiry and a little poetry.

IV.VI

Woke, let Charlie out, fed she and Nubs. Neighbor Stan came to the door and said, “Aw man, I thought Kevin was here. I was hoping for a ride.” I said, “I’ll give you a ride, bud!”
   we went to Instant Karma to pick up some candles and then walked to Beanwerks for coffees. We drove home, where I drank my coffee, looked at my phone and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I rested while charging my phone and eventually walked with Charlie up to my house, where I took a bath, wrote a personal bio, drank a cup of coffee and packed a bag of additional things to have on hand while pet sitting, like pajama pants. We then walked back to Hendrix St., where I ate some food and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I walked up to Cellarest, where Dan was playing, ordered a hop water and sat outside in the sun. Ryan showed up w/ Max and we talked about the album he has been recording all week with Lillie Syracuse. It was getting cold, so we went inside for the second set, which is when Melissa showed up. I ordered a kombucha and chatted with her about the funeral she had just played until Alex McWalters arrived.
   Melissa took Max home and I chatted with Alex about the book he had been working on for three years, and how I had recently started sharing my journals. “You’re the first person I’ve told,” I said.
   We hugged and Ryan gave me a ride to Hendrix, where I ate chips, made rice and wrote in my journal.

IV.VII

I fed the monsters, drank a French press of coffee, sat in the sun, made rice and then drove with Charlie up to my house where I added red pepper flakes and peas. I drove to the Baltimore, set up my drums on the gazebo and played four hours of music with Dulci, Ryan and Melissa. I got sad on the drive home and re-listened to Waiting in Vain, the last song we played. 

IV.IX

The rain was hypnotic. We slept with the window open til 11AM, at which point I drank a coffee and gathered my things. We drove down to Zeppelin, where I fed the monsters and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I made peas n’ rice plus a French press of coffee and spent the afternoon eating, drinking, napping and typing on the computer. At six-thirty, I walked to rehearsal with Ryan, Melissa, Charlie, Dulci, Blella(h), June and Max before coming back to Hendrix, eating chocolate out of the pantry and writing in my journal.

IV.X

I woke at eight and set my drums for a rehearsal with Ryan and Tina. The center of my back was hurting from being yanked around by Charlie, so I laid down immediately after practice instead of helping them carry things to their cars. I laid on the floor for a while and came up with a plan for the day.
   I walked Charlie down to my house and changed my damp socks, drank a coffee and then walked back down to Hendrix alone. I gathered some things and drove the car up to Meyers, took a bath, made food (after listening to Okonski's Magnolia.) I looked at my phone for a while and then drove to Open Folk.
   I ordered an Athletic, sat by the fire pit*, got another drink with Hannah & Chris, talked to Rita about a possible emergency photo shoot, watched the second set, went across the street for a heart-to-heart and then drove home to Charlie the Dog.
   I slept from midnight til 430, ate a clementine, drank a tangerine bubbly, listened to some songs, smoked and wrote in my journal.

IV.XI

I napped, walked Charlie down to her house in the rain and then walked to Aldi, Izzy's, the market and my house. I sat on the porch, added more espresso to my latte and wrote in my journal, feeling as dreary as the weather.

. . .

I took a bath, drove to Hendrix, made food and laid down in bed. Melissa and Max came over to give me a hug. After a convo on the porch, I went back to bed and eventually fell asleep.

IV.XII

I was woken by the monsters, fed them, made a French press and drank the whole thing while packing up my drums and other petsitting belongings. I did the dishes, made the bed, sat outside and wrote in my journal.

. . .

Gnarly and I took my possessions and drove up to my house. I probably drank a coffee and then walked Charlie the Dog back to Kev's house. I went to Aldi, Izzy's, the market and my house after that.
   Tina picked me up at 315, and we drove two hours to the John C. Campbell Folk School. An arts camp full of students were congratulating each other in the concert hall when we got there. I drank coffee in the wings until they were done. Then, we set up for a TaHP performance, sound checked, went to the caf for a very quick dinner and then played a concert.
   I rode with Kim & Ted back to Asheville and quickly fell asleep.

IV.XIII

I woke, drank a coffee and drove the Mini to Rare Bird Farm, where I set up my drums in the barn and sat in the sun until Kevin, Dulci and Wyndham arrived. We sound checked, ate dinner, watched Sam, played 70 mins of music and packed up our things.
   I drove back to the west side and then walked downtown to Mamacita's for a burrito and then Madison Cunningham at the Orange Peel. I caught a ride home from Gary, where we listened to music and ate tons of clementines.

IV.XIV

Woke and walked to Izzy's for a quad red-eye before sending out invitations to my bday party. I went to Aldi after that, got a beer from UJ, walked home, dropped off my groceries, walked to Ingles for soy sauce and bubbles, went home, made food, walked to Malvern Hills, ate and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I played a game of chess with Charlie in the park and lost. We walked to Kev's house for a Dulci band photo shoot and played another game on the porch while everyone did whatever it is they do when they first get together. We took some photos around the house and then some more in the park.
   I walked to Odd’s for an iced latte and got a text from Melissa saying they were going to Muñoz. I walked home, got the car, drove to Muñoz, ate three tamales outside with Ryan, Melissa, Dulci, Kevin, Alyse and Max before driving home, eating grapes in the bath and falling asleep til 3AM.
   I woke, listened to Let it Die and laid awake.

IV.XV

I woke after 10, drank a coffee in the hammock, made another, walked to Aldi, then Odd’s, where I ordered a latte and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I went home, ate chocolate, typed on my computer and eventually walked up to the Pump. They were closed, but I realized that didn’t matter to me at all, so I sat in the gas station parking lot and watched people arrive.
   Grant wanted to go to UJ, so I had a hop water with him there. Around 430, we went back to the Pump, where I ate hibachi, bought a 12-pack of Athletic and drove down to Middlemont.
   We had Hannah rehearsal on the porch, and then I drove to the Mashup. They finished playing at 11:15. I drove home and cried myself to sleep, woke at 3AM, took a bath, went back to bed and had life-or-death dreams.

IV.XVI

I awoke an hour before my alarm, made my bed, tidied the kitchen and the bathroom, made coffee and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I drove to Scott's and was the first one there. Scott was he was playing guitar on his porch when I got there rehearsal Ever-Expanding rehearsal drove Charlie to her house, no, met my mom at my house, swapped Minis, drove Charlie home, came back, emptied my pockets and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I set off for downtown, sat on my secret staircase to nowhere and called my mom. She had taken a nap in her car and was waiting at the ballpark, so I walked there and met her an hour-and-a-half before the game was set to start.
   We each got two hot dogs, sat by third base and were joined by Pops and many good friends [Ted, Ryan, Max, Jason, Dulci, Dan, Finn, Millie, Will, Hannah, Scott, Leann, Steve, Marissa, Melissa and Charlie.] The Tourists played great, made lots of double plays and even won the game in a timely manner. Some of us had a nostalgic hang in the parking lot and then parted ways. I fell asleep early compared to most birthdays.

IV.XVII

I slept more than I had been lately and dreamt less crazily, but still had a very awake period from 5-8. I woke again at 1045, drank two cups of coffee and managed my calendar, wrote in my journal.

. . .

I made food and drove to Open Folk, mainly to see Ryan. I was feeling very tired after that, so after helping stack chairs, I drove home, made more food and fell asleep.

IV.XVIII

I picked up Kevin and drove to the shed, where we started making music at 1030. at six, we drove to his house, where we had Dulci band rehearsal til 930. I went to UJ after that, ate a felafel burger with tots, drank an Athletic, drove home and took a bath. I was feeling clean and restless, so I put on some shorts, a T-shirt and walked up to the Country Club for another Mathletic. I went home and listened to Hannah Kaminer songs.

IV.XIX

I woke after a nice rain, made a cup of coffee, listened to Heavy on the Vine, packed my drums in the convertible, called my dad, ate a banana, made another cup of coffee and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I drove down to Ryan and Melissa's, chatted with them about a gig, and then, once Hannah arrived, loaded up her car and rode to Columbia. She, Ryan and I played for a couple hours and then drove back to Altamont, very tired. We unloaded our gas station snacks and musical equipment, then parted ways.
   I slept soundly.

IV.XX

I woke and manically posted to social media regarding the Ever-Expanding record having been released. I retrieved my new pair of Rainbow flip flops from the mailbox and walked up to Odd’s for a quad latte. I felt at peace drinking it in the sun on their back porch.
   I went to Aldi for fruits and veggies, came home and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I packed a bag and drove out to Swananoa for the Sticky Icky, where I ate pizza and played a 90-minute set w/ Dulci, Kevin, Alyse, Charlie, Ryan and Melissa. I ate more pizza, walked down to the river, ate more pizza and drove downtown to Thomas Kozak’s CD release.
   There was a beautiful collection of people and sounds in the room. We grounded that energy by going to the WALK, where we pushed three or four tables together and did our best to not overwork their only two servers.
   Everyone was tired and we talked about how hard they were going to sleep before parting ways.

IV.XXI

I made coffee, listened to the Thomas Kozak EP and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I drove to the American Ballroom Company in Canton, where Kevin and I played two hours of music to dancers of all ages. I packed my drums in the car and drove to Zilly, where Hannah Kaminer was playing music with the Hillclimbers. I ordered food + an NA beer. The bands had been moved inside due to cold weather, and the bar patrons were talking a bit loudly.
   I met a cool dog named Toby and drove to Static Age Loft, where Millie and three other songwriters were playing in a round. I drank a Mathletic Lite, chatted with Christina and drove home, took a bath. I was tired and fell asleep.

IV.XXII

Took my drums out of the convertible, made two cups of coffee and drove down to Centerford for rehearsal with Tina, Melissa, Ryan and Max, where I had a third cup of coffee. At 1, I drove up to the shed, where we spontaneously wrote one song and demoed another.
   Kev and I went to Muñoz after that, ate and talked about therapy. I grabbed a latte and an iced coffee from Odd's and drove down to Kev's house where we had rehearsal with Hannah and Jackson. We worked on the arrangement of one song and ran through nine or ten others until we realized how late it was. I drove home, ate all the grapes and fell fast asleep.

IV.XXIII

Drove to the shed and worked on six songs. I listened to them afterwards and then drove home, changed my clothes and speedwalked to the bank downtown in about an hour. I walked to Wedge, ordered an Athletic and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I walked up to the Pump, where Blessed Soul food truck was serving. I ordered a burger w/ fries, baked beans + mac & cheese, told my friends I was tired after eating all that, walked home and fell asleep with my clothes on.

IV.XXIV

I made a cup of coffee and drank it in the back garden, listened to the new Dr. Dog song, put on my rain coat and walked up to Aldi for grapes, citrus, bananas, peas & kidney beans. I walked to Odd's after that, ordered a latte and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I walked up to the Pump for some El Kimchi and settled on a bulgogi beef burrito. I walked back home and decided it was the best time of day to drive with the top down, so I arrived at Haiku around 630, ordered a Trail Pass and sat on a rock in the sun while people arrived.
   I packed up all the chairs after Open Folk, drove home, made noodles and — wait, no. first, I went to Country Club. I had some friends there, but they were very drunk. I drove over to the Pump as it was closing, chatted with Chad and Loomis for a minute, then popped over to UJ and the Pub, neither of which I enjoyed, so that’s when I went home, made noodles and fell asleep.

IV.XXV

I woke up thinking about how I had the whole day off, so, after charging my phone, I set off for downtown, went to AVL Club, ordered an Americano, sat in the window and wrote in my journal. I had a text from Dulci asking if we were still down to rehearse tonight, which I had forgot to put in my calendar, so I guess I don’t have a day off after all, which is a bummer, but also makes me feel accomplished.

. . .

I sat in the park, drank another coffee, walked back to the west side and watched the Ever-Expanding session from Secret Sounds. I walked up to the Pump, ordered a burrito from El Kimchi and walked to Izzy's for a coffee.
   I had something stuck in my tooth and could not get it out. The coffee shop closed, so I sat by the park and texted Allen to see if he was home and had any floss. He wasn’t, but said his house was unlocked.
   That issue resolved, I went to Malvern Hills and read my book until a fight broke out in the street. I stuck around to deescalate things but left before having to talk to any cops. I went to rehearsal with Wyndham, Dulci, Kevin, Charlie and Alyse until about 10 and started walking home.
   I ran into a drunk Myles, gave him a ride, had an Athletic at the Club, went home and fell asleep.

IV.XXVI

I woke at 8 to a canceled 9AM rehearsal, so I stayed in bed and looked at my phone for four hours until I picked up Cait and went to Mizu. We talked about life and I took her home, where I felt like the weather, rainy and a little bored. I made a third cup of coffee and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I drove to Ingles for lactose-free chocolate ice cream and then to the Reckard home, where I had dinner with Gary, Fox, Darwin, Zelda and Lucy. Darwin was pushing buttons on the radio while Gary gave me a tour of their new RV and found Fwuit on the airwaves.
   We ate pizza and ice cream until Lucy left for the Grey Eagle and I got a text from rebekah asking if I wanted to join her for a show at AyurPrana, which was amazing. We drove to One Stop after that, realized it wasn’t our scene and went to the Whale instead, where we caught up on how crazy life had been since seeing each other three years earlier.

IV.XXVII

Walked to Kev's house for rehearsal with he and Hannah, and had a nice sit in the park beforehand. We ran through our set list and then swung by my house, Hannah’s house and Chipotle before driving to Columbia for a garden party.
   We played three songs, delayed for rain, hung in the house for a drink, resumed the set, packed our things and headed home. Jackson asked me to tell a story along the way, and I could only think of Holy Ghost breaking down in Placerville, CA.

IV.XXVIII

Woke, drove to the shed and worked or reworked four-five new tunes before driving out to Sylva for my mom’s bday dinner. I bought a box of Cheez-Its on the way home and ate the whole thing in an effort to decompress.

IV.XXIX

Woke to the sounds of the neighbor vacuuming out their car. I went downstairs to escape it, but realized I was out of coffee, so I walked to Kota Kai, the market, Aldi, Odd's and back home, where I sat on the couch and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I got up to do the dishes and had missed a call from Hannah. We made plans to collect my drums at dinner time and so I told her my plan as I was realizing it of walking downtown to make the most of my day off. She too was headed downtown and told me where she would be.
   I went to AVL Club after meeting with her and had a coffee in the park. She picked me up, but I no longer needed my drums since we would be practicing at her house on Wednesday, so we went and got burgers at Olde London Road instead and talked about what dog breeds we would be.
   I took a bath after she dropped me off and walked to the Mashup, where I had good talks with Devon & Troy before heading home and falling asleep.

IV.XXX

Woke, made coffee, drove to Kev's, then the shed. We recorded four songs and then moved an organ back to Kev's house. I went to UJ for a sandwich, Odd's for a latte, home to listen to music and then Kev's for Dulci rehearsal. I swung by Ingles on my way home for grapes and then fell fast asleep.


. . .

V.I

I woke to 27 messages about the tunes we had just recorded. I listened to a Jon Charles Dwyer record under my blanket and then walked to Battle Cat. My main card was declined, so once I had drank most of my coffee, I decided to walk downtown to the bank, where I deposited a hundo bill I had been carrying around for eleven days.
   I went to AVL Club after that, ordered an Americano and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I ordered another coffee, sat in the park, changed my shoes and walked home, unable to decide on anything to eat. I hung at the house for a while and eventually decided to eat a cold Italian from Pizza Mind.
   I drove to rehearsal at Hannah’s house with Melissa and Jackson, then gave Hannah a ride to Ingles. We texted sweetly after that and I listened to a record by Luther somebody; she had sent me a song from it about a cricket.

V.II

What a day. In no particular order, I wrote in my journal and elsewhere. I drank four cups of coffee, set up my VCR, watched Driving Miss Daisy, made a bagel sandwich and never left the house.

V.III

I went on a 9AM walk with Hannah, drove to the shed, honed in on some tunes, drove to the coffee shop, then headed east on I-40. I had a sit at a rest stop to assess why I was feeling so agitated and then drove to Hickory, where we played Under the Sails with Dulci, Charlie, Ryan, Alyse, Wyndham and Kevin, a powerful band.
   I drove home and fell fast asleep.

V.IV

Made a cup of coffee, walked to Aldi, swung by Kota Kai for a sit, walked home, took a bath, made transportation arrangements and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I made a third coffee, went down to Hannah’s, loaded her care in the rain and drove to the Purple Onion. We loaded in, set up, hung in the greenroom, ate dinner and started our set.
   Things sounded amazing to me for about 10 songs, but things slowly started to go wrong and Hannah lost her composure. Things started getting to fast. We packed up and drove home in the rain.
   I couldn’t help but tell Hannah I was there to love her however she needed. She was overwhelmed at first but then said the way she needed was as a friend. She asked if that was okay and I said yes. I apologized for making things difficult. She said I was kind and honest, so she understood. I said she’s pretty awesome, herself.
   I went towards my car and said, “Well, I love ya’.” She said, “I don’t think you mean like ‘I love ya’ bud.’” I said, “No, I don’t.” She said, “Well, I can’t say that back.” I said that was okay and we hugged. I forgot about how she told me not to overthink it if I knew what she meant, and I said I did not; I had been thinking about it a lot.
   I sped home and got in bed. She said she should have instead told me to be kind to myself also. I appreciated the clarification and wanted her to know my desire to be kind, fun and helpful did not come with expectation.
   “I know,” she said. “Thank you.”

the fucking birds went nuts at 4AM and my sleep became erratic.

. . .

There was also the part where I said, “I don’t want to change anything… if you don’t.” that was probably after I said I was okay with being friends.

V.V

I made a coffee, drank it, wrote in my journal and walked up to Kota Kai. Apparently they're closed on Sundays, so I went to Odd's, where both my cards got declined. I transferred money from checking to shares and back again, then took my latte to drink in front of the Brew Pump. I looked so down on my luck that a man asked if I needed a dollar. I said sure.
   I walked past the Ingles egg protesters and down to Hannah’s house at exactly 12:30. we loaded her car and talked very little about the night before. In fact, her asking if I had gotten enough sleep may not have been as directly related to my heartbreak as I assumed it to be.
   We listened to Okonski, stopped at an Ingles Starbucks for coffee and food items. I took over driving and we talked the whole way there until listening to U2 at the very end. We arrived at the neighborhood and did a tour of the art festival due to not knocking on the door hard enough or checking the back yard.
   We re-arrived at the same time as Jackson, set up, ate arepas, played a great set. I started to feel blue towards the end and got a little bombastic at times as a temper tantrum. I moped around in a manner that only my friend’s would recognize, packed up the car, said goodbyes and got on the road with Jackson.
   We talked about quitting alcohol, loving Hannah, music & psychology, stopped at the Saluda Marathon, drove to Asheville in the rain. Hannah and I DMed a surprising amount after that, more than I had intended.

V.VI

I woke at 1130, made a coffee and thought about all my recent choices with shame. I wrote about the ways I regretted interacting with Hannah and the chemical/habitual reasons for it. With the help of a second cup of coffee, it went through 4 new drafts from therapy to cringe love bombing. At least I was doing laundry.
   I also listened to four new Scott demos, wrote to that band, my sister, my mom, Maryclaire.
   I fleshed out my discography, made it the front page of my website, got a call from Hannah about trading off my drums, folded and put away my clothes, walked to Ingles, ate Cheez-Its and talked to Isiah on the way home, made a bagel sandwich, cleaned my bathroom and wrote in my journal.
   I feel relief of the fear of rejection from Hannah, which optimistically translates to less attachment to the outcome of our relationship. I’m still excited to see her though. I realized on my walk home it’s okay to not have monk-like resistance to hits of dopamine, but I may be the man for the job of working toward that goal.

. . .

I made food and hung out on the couch until Hannah arrived. She helped me unload my drums and then offered me some grapes, for which I traded a hop water in return. I thought about watching Babe, but a thunder storm was rolling in, so I watched that instead.

V.VII

I drank a cup of coffee, packed my bag and walked downtown to AVL Club for a second coffee. I was sitting in the park when I heard JB call to me, who was heading to Yacht Club way before they opened.
   We played a game of chess outside AVL Club and were soon joined by Cait. She and I walked down Mushroom Lane, split a pill, went to Mamacita's, the co-op an art store, the parking garage and my house. She was a little unsure about having sex but eventually decided it was a good idea while we listened to Khruangbin.
   She went home while I finished off. I was getting late to pick Alyse up, but also right on time. We went to the shed, ate pizza in the yard, played through the set twice and departed. I went to the Patton Ave. Ingles and then ended up behind Hannah on Haywood.
   I fell asleep texting with her and Cait.

I forgot to mention how I had seen a very fine looking Maddy Rojas while sitting with JB. She was clearly on a date. After Cait left, I noticed I had her number and texted her asking if she’d like to go on one with me, which we scheduled for Thursday.

V.X

woke, made coffee, listened to two Nurse Cat songs and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I walked to Middlemont for rehearsal with Ryan and Tina, then got a group text from Dulci saying she, Alyse and Becca had been asked to sing w/ Dr. Dog. I walked to Aldi, Izzy's and home while obsessing over my desire to be invited to somehow tag along.
   I listened to night four of the San Francisco album and fell asleep for a couple hours, dreaming of farting around Scott's house with him, Kevin & Leann.
   I made an overly toasted bagel and rotted in bed until it was time to walk to Odd for the Sun Goblin show. I enjoyed watching bands I wouldn’t normally see, but started getting tired ruing their set, especially once Hannah group-texted about the Aurora borealis.
   I couldn’t see it on my cold walk home. I texted her to say as much, and she eventually responded, “I saw it only briefly.”

V.XI

I woke at 7 feeling lonely and depressed. I slept til noon, dreaming of things I need to move to Scott's house. He had said today was a good day for that, but did not respond when I asked about noon.
   I reluctantly made a coffee, started responding to texts from the day before, got back into bed and wrote in my journal.

Today marks 10 weeks of no drinking. I wish I felt more accomplished. I at least have the insight of knowing I would have gotten wasted last night and blamed my low feelings on the alcohol.
   I am loosening my grip on things but it is very painful. I guess I am grateful no one has to watch me be this miserable. I would probably lie to them about how I am feeling and what I did all day — at least two years ago. I told Scott I would just bring stuff on Sunday and went up to the Brew Pump, where I got surrounded by the aggressively boring conversation of Travis, case, Brian and not-boring-but-oddly-softspoken Grant.
   I texted Hannah asking if we could throw the frisbee some time and she said that would be nice and that she would come to the Honeycutters Greagle show, so I finally felt like eating and bathing.
   We ended up walking up to the venue at the same time, ordering food, waiting outside. We had a awkward interaction with some guy, and when he walked away, she said:
   “He broke my friend’s heart. He brought up some stuff in her that she needed to work on, and maybe anyone would have, but he was uniquely suited.”
   “Yeah, that seems to be who we’re attracted to.”
   “I’m sorry…”
   “Oh, I wasn’t trying to be specific.” I was staring up at the tv screen. “That just seems to be going around, or what humans do in general.”
   We ate, sat in the back row, had a great time hollering, were joined by Alyse and loitered around after the show. We tried to find the Aurora Borealis outside afterwards but could not see it. I may have missed an opportunity to kiss her even if she didn’t 100% want me to.
   She gave me a ride to my car. I followed her partway home. I fell asleep.

V.XII

Woke at 930, made coffee, packed drums, drove down to Sierra Nevada, set up and sat in the sun. Ryan was over an hour late so sound check bled into food time. Kim Furstenberg pestered me through my whole meal.
   The set was sloppy due to the Hymanbergs not caring at all. I stared feeling heartbroken towards the break and then got further pestered by Kim, who was grabbing me by the arm and demanding to know me. Melissa had told her I was like a cat, so I swatted and hissed at her and told her she would have to keep trying.
   Second set was a drag, but I loaded out quickly. I drove home, traded vehicles, drove to the shed, unloaded gear and sat around miserable while Kevin and Alyse tracked parts to a horror movie credit song produced by Scott and written by Greg.
   Greg eventually came back with popsicles, and I recorded a sick part on the bomba. We called it a wrap at midnight. I had texted Hannah to see how her day was, but she gave me the bare minimum, truly.
   I drove home, ate cold burrito/popsicle and actually slept soundly.

V.XIII

I woke feeling miserable again, made coffee and wrote in my journal.

It has been nearly three months of believing Hannah and I would be good for each other but accepting that she is not willing to try. Today is not my first time sitting with the reality that she could not give me what I needed even if she was willing to try. Who could? I know I’m not too much, but the whole world seems so unwilling to step outside their fortress. Am I that way? Not with Hannah, I haven't been, but this is a rare moment, and I suppose that’s what love is really created on.

. . .

I drove to Cait’s and recognized she was about four seconds away from having a shitty attitude. We rode to Mizu, had a delicious lunch under the fluorescent lights, listened to Echo and parted ways.
   Before that, I had texted Hanna saying she was important to me; I knew navigating our friendship was difficult but I was proud of us for trying. She agreed and returned the sentiment, said she and Goldie were listening to Cinderella and observing the cats.
   Two hours later, she was wondering if she had missed something. I said no; I had just been struggling lately, and that felt like a way of sharing my feelings without pressuring her to do the same. She said she knew it has been hard on me but didn’t know what to do.
   I quadruple texted her with almost every pent-up feeling and observation of the situation over the past three months. She said she had been thinking about giving me space, that she had been in my position before and went to therapy/Codependents Anonymous over it. She also decided to remind me she might date someone soon.
   I wrung out every last feeling I had, acknowledging that I was entering into the painful acceptance phase as opposed to what I thought we could have, that I had been dating as well.
   She said she couldn’t process any more in the moment and that she would focus on hanging out where we already overlap — like Open Folk and band practice.
   I said I was going to pick up a cute TV/VCR and she agreed it was cute.
   I drove to the SECU on Hendersonville Rd., but the guy said he was reconsidering the price and his wife was taking over the sale. Instead, I drove to Scott's house where he, Kev and I worked on a song until one in the morning.
   I came home and made peas n’ noodles from the Shin ramen I had bought from YZ Market with Cait.

V.XIV

I woke to a dreary day, feeling as unattached as I had since I dumped all my feelings onto Hannah. I thought about walking downtown, but it was rainy and I couldn’t decide on footwear, so I made a coffee and then wrote in my journal.

My major fear/sadness today (while less than most recent days) is not that I will be alone, or that an opportunity for love has been missed, but that the promise of a bond that transcended limitations of mundane logistics will no longer come to fruition; getting together and playing good songs cool may be the best we can do. I may not be allowed to give any more of myself than that.
   So be it. I will hang out with Scott until the early morning exploring what is possible beyond the limits of the rehearsal/gig dynamic that so many of my bands are now limited to.

. . .

I decided a walk was critical, so I head out the door and walked to Battle Cat, where I drank an Americano in the rain and sat between someone who would have never stopped loudly talking about crypto and someone who wanted to talk to me about how enlightened she was for not believing in security.
   I walked downtown, started chewing on a mushroom stem, gave half to a guy who looked like he needed it and sat under a tree in the park.

Before that, as I was about to pass over a bridge, I realized I was feeling no attachment to Hannah, which was nice on its own, but more interestingly, no attachment to anything for the first time in my life. I’m not sure how true that was.

I got up from under the tree and found High-Five coffee. Nothing interested me, so I used the restroom, walked next door to the Vault, ordered a $6 Athletic, put it in my cup and went back to the park. I sat in the sun until my beer was empty and went up to the library. I didn’t like who I had seen working at AVL Club, so I sat on a bench and listened to a schizophrenic girl talk to an imaginary friend about a tear salesman until 5PM.
   I still didn’t like the new AVL Club bartender, so I went to High-Five, ordered a cup of drip and, when I went to use the gift card Cait had given me for my birthday, I realized it was merely a punch card. I went back to the park until my coffee was lukewarm and then headed back west, stopping to pee at the Greagle.
   I went up Riverview Drive and was loudly greeted by a good ol’ boy from his porch. I asked if he wanted a mushroom and he said, “You been dry-land fishin’?” which took me a minute to understand and then said they were psychedelic. He said, “Hell no.” I was paranoid the cops would come get me until I made it to Archetype to pee.
   I walked to the Brew Pump, ordered a burger, and a  song about Where the Wild Things Are was playing, which Hannah had checked out while we were riding down to Columbia, so I sent her a DM saying I hoped her soft opening was fun and easy and that I thought that info was worth reporting.
   I ate my burger, walked home and laid on the couch. I thought about how lonely I was and whether anyone could ever save me from that. Hannah had written back saying work was crazy and asking how the Pump was. I said I was at the house listening to the birds. She asked what they were talking about and I said they thought it was a long day; only the crickets were singing now.
   I wrote a poem about that, hoping she would ask what they were singing about, but she only agreed it was a very long day. I spent hours refining the poem, sending, unsending, refining, etc. I slept hard during the rain and, ate 4AM, decided the first line was too heavy and that she would feel like me sending a poem would be making her process my issue no matter what, so I unsent it again.

V.XV

I woke at nine and decided I would follow an impulse from the previous day: no coffee. It is a radical decision, but after feeling the notion of reduced attachments, I think it will be a worthwhile experiment. Obviously, my attachment to Hannah has returned. I ‘thought’ about her three times last night, spent hours working on a poem and am very curious to see if and what she will text me today regarding Open Folk tonight. The alternative of Dulci rehearsal sounds like a real drag. I am somewhat excited to see what a day of diligently doing nothing brings, however I should also be realistic since I had three cups yesterday and, if a headache approaches, have one delicious cup.

   We tire from hearing the sky full of feelings
   Tweeting them all ain’t too nice
   that’s why we’re quietest during the daylight
   And keep it to one song a night

   Busy with hopping and chirping and perching
   Our friends they have so much to say
   And so we play lonesome songs only by nightfall
   Leaving space for the birds in the day.

. . .

I laid on the couch til 1230, walked down to Kev's let out Charlie, walked up to Haywood, got rained on, went into Izzy's for a 2PM latte, got an idea for a song, walked home and figure out how I could record. I forced a couple things and then started trying to make Erica's Zoom recorder work as a USB interface, but despite working once, there was typically a lot of lag.
   I eventually got frustrated and decided to make food while writing in my journal.

. . .

I dilly dallied until it was time to leave on foot, and started an overly dramatic conflicted text to Hannah, poetic even:

   Hey, how’s your day?
   Are you going to Open Folk tonight?
   I wish I could
   But we are learning Diva tunes at Kevin's.

She texted me one minute later saying she was about to text me about this, but when I said I could get out of rehearsal, she changed her mind.
   I walked back home and drove to rehearsal. I was miserable and Melissa showed up with an annoying look on her face + a distracting vibe. We learned three songs in 2.5 hours and confirmed she had put zero thought into how we would get to our Moon & You gig or where her child would go. I also booked a LaZoom gig.
   When I got home, I told Hannah I would be free for next week, but she was scheduled to work. We talked about how the days at Haiku are numbered and she offered that we could throw frisbee on Friday. I apologized for unloading so many emotions and she appreciated that.
   I see now she wasn’t originally specific about Friday but offered generalized frisbee for a consolation for not overlapping at Open Folk … ai yai yai, her brain. I felt better about life, though. I showed her my HGTR frisbee and fell asleep. 

One of the struggles from practice was the lyrical content of Don’t Speak. It did feel a lot like I was losing my best friend, which I know is a flag for codependency, but it makes me wonder: who is her best friend? She rarely mentions anyone without an eye roll. I’m sure I get one too.

V.XVI

I took a niiiiice nap, got a call from Hannah about scheduling, drove to Olde London Rd., ate a burger special, came home, looked at my phone, ate a popsicle, packed my drums, groomed, drank the tiniest bit of espresso and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I drove down to Middlemont and laid in a hammock until Ryan came outside. After loading stuff into the Element, he and I rode in the convertible to Spruce Pine. We set up gear in a pocket park; I drank an espresso while waiting for Melissa to arrive.
   It took a while, but I eventually found a Heineken 0. we played two sets, the first on distorted speakers. I drove back to Asheville, got an Athletic from the Country Club, went across the street to Ingles, bought a notebook, got another beer and wrote some lyrics.
   I went home, figured out the web-based DAW BandLab and worked on Make an Album til 2AM.

V.XVII

I woke, looked at my phone, messed around with BandLab on the hog and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I walked to the bank, got a $100 bill for the basement and sat in the park. I walked back west and sat at Battle Cat with an Americano for ages. I walked home and then drove to Hannah’s house. We ate chicken tendies, then walked to Dobra for boba + snacks.
   We swung by a plant library for a tomato start, went back to her house and threw the frisbee for 10 minutes. I drove to Middlemont, where we (Ryan, Melissa, Dulci and Max) rehearsed for a couple hours and then drove home.
   I asked Hannah how her cake had turned out and apparently she had botched the icing. I was slightly surprised when she agreed to let me trade a fresh box delivery for an XLR cable. I also got her grapes + Cheez-Its, grapes and peas for myself.
   We hung in the kitchen and on the stoop with her roommate. I realize now how calculated that may have been, but she is always over there. I went home, checked my new mic setup and soon went to bed.

V.XVIII

I slept a little late for my date with Maddy and so hoofed it straight downtown. She was at a plant sale where Gary/Juan used to work, so I met her there. We walked to themed, reserved a table, went to Malaprop's, slightly awkwardly, then back to themed.
   We had a fun & yummy brunch, then walked to her apartment to drop off her leftovers. She had me wait in the yard. I said I had about an hour left to kill but couldn’t think of anything to do. I was surprised and delighted when she suggested a walk to West Asheville.
   We walked to my house with a stop at the Bottle Shop for a fruited sour and a pee break at the Grey Eagle. We hung in the back garden where she declined my invitation to make out. I drove her home, went to Ryan's, then to the Wag Bar.
   I went to the Ether Jam after that, then home, where I chatted with Maddy and Hannah. I fell asleep just before midnight.


V.XIX

I woke, ate a banana, took trash out of my room and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I am enjoying the familiarity of Maddy, like how she knows Cait, sunny and Erica. She seems to have grown a lot since I last knew her. The fact that I am unsure about what I want to do with myself today is combining strangely with the idea that she wants to hang out, the impending rain and a fear of straying from Hannah.

. . .

I started to walk downtown and she invited me to her house. I said hi to Sierra and got a double espresso, then went to High-Five and ran into Jacob. Maddy and I sat on the floor and talked about our traumas until we decided to eat some Five Points.
   We stopped by her house and decided to do creative things at my house. We stopped at the Montford for the view, but the service was not happening, so we left. We walked in the rain to the Brew Pump, where she got a tallboy and I got a six-pack of Trail Pass.
   We came to the house, listened to music for a while, kissed a little and then walked back to the pump, sat on the swing. We listened to drunken stories from Tim, came home, made a zine, ate peas n’ noodles, watched Disney's Robin Hood, laid down in the master bedroom and had sex.

V.XX

We woke, got dressed, ate popsicles and rode to Maddy's house. I drove to Aldi after that for peas & grapes, went home and actually started working on Travis’ keyboards.
   I got the schematics mostly finished, ate a banana and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I did nothing but work on PCBs all day. I accomplished a lot and fell asleep by early nightfall.

V.XXI

I woke, routed a JST, incorporated a couple edge cuts, put the files in a public repo and sent a message to Travis. I walked to Aldi, then Izzy's, then Odd's after sitting in front of the library.
   I got a call from Cait, wanting a ride to the store. I realized after hanging up she must be drunk. I drank a Trail Pass on her porch, ate some mushies and some burnt nuggets.
   We eventually picked up a Barbie friend from the library and checked out the river spot by the nature center. Cait did not last long, ordered ramen for us and we headed home. We ate it with a surprise visit from Elena and then cuddled for 15 minutes.
   I went to Kev's house, where we worked on Pink Pony Club, Ariana Grande, Cranberries x2 and Golden Girls. I drove home and felt dirty/tired. I probably fell asleep kinda early and had really cool dreams.

V.XXII

I ate some fruit, walked downtown, got a coffee from High-Five, drank it in the park, repeated, walked the wrong way to Wasabi, saw Eden, who suggested we get a beer, ate two sushi rolls, had a pee at the Greagle, an Athletic at Wedge, got offered an apple by my new friend James at the bust stop who had enthusiastically declined my mushroom offer, went to Country Club, ordered an athletic, drank some w/ Jesse, walked to the Pump until Brian and Travis started boring me, walked home, started making peas + noodles and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I went to the first half of Open Folk and Ingles for grapes & popsicles. I took a bath and was delighted to have a text from Hannah. I slept hard.

V.XXIII

I woke and was looking at videos on my phone when a cat came up to my room. I followed it downstairs, made a cup of coffee, put some gas in the car and drove to the Wolf Laurel community center for a 19” TV/VCR combo. The drive and community were beautiful.
   I stopped at a cool-looking gas station on the way out and got a sausage biscuit with my last $5. I drove home, watched Mystic Pizza, made some noodles, texted w/ Maddy, Hannah, Cait, Lucy and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I watched Speed and a little bit of a Peter Rabbit movie after talking to Maddy on the phone.

V.XXIV

I woke, drank a cup of coffee and drove to Maddy's work. We went to the arboretum, did a good bit of hiking and then shared a beet pizza at Pizza Mind.
   We had drinks at Botiwalla, went to Ingles & the market, back home, had sex and watched You’ve Got Mail. I drove her home after that, got a cortado from All Day Darling, swung by the Brew Pump, realized Lamont should host a chess tournament, went home, ate some noodles, realized it was time to go to the airport, picked up Erica, ate more noodles, watched half of Jurassic Park, a little bit of Austin Powers and fell asleep.

V.XXV

I woke, made my bed, packed up my drums, made a cup of coffee and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I picked up Maddy and we drove to the Carl Sandberg house in Flat Rock, walked some trails, wrote some notes, pet some goats. We had brunch at a fancy place nearby, she Benedict and me a burger, shared — Campfire Grill.
   We drove to Saluda after that and had a great time meeting people in various galleries, eventually playing Scrabble at the Saluda Inn, having a beer at the hidden little tavern, ice cream in the garden.
   Melissa and she became besties immediately. We shared a salmon special and the band played a very fun set. We drove to the Walmart in Hendo where Maddy bought a Crosley and then zipped back up to Asheville listening to ABBA. I was getting a little cranky from driving.
   We had sex and went to sleep on her two twin mattresses, side by side. I didn’t have enough blanket and was falling into the crack.

V.XXVI

I left around 745, got a coffee from Battle Cat — a latte — drove home, drank it in bed, walked to Aldi feeling kind of nauseated. I napped until Wyndham arrived and then had an awkward exchange with him and Erica.
   I drank another coffee, drove to the Bojangles off exit 55, ate a Cajun filet sandwich combo and then drank a Heineken 0 at the Root Bar. I drove to the Monte Vista Hotel where my new bestie Chris, Taylor Watkins and I set up in a dining room and rocked out hard for Taylor's friends and one enthusiastic older couple. I ate a burger from the buffet.
   I should have gone to the Town Pump or maybe to Matt & Morgan’s dinosaur party w/ Cait. Instead, I went to Maddy's house where a punk jumped all over me, grabbing my neck, poking my belly button, putting her hands down my pants and demanding affirmations. We did have a nice walk to Harris Teeter for Cheez-Its.
   I left around 1230, came home, got in bed and enjoyed the rain.

V.XXVII

I slept til nearly 11, made a cup of coffee, listened to Erica talk about her various flutes and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I laid in bed for a long time and eventually drove to Goodwill, where I purchased Mission Impossible, Vanilla Sky, and Autumn in New York. I drove home and walked up to Kota Kai, where I thumbed through a National Geographic while drinking a coffee.
   I went to Orbit and bought The Color Purple, Fallen, Pretty Woman, Conspiracy Theory and Top Dog. Hannah texted me saying she had tried eating only fruit, that she enjoyed it and was contemplating a walk, so I went down to her house, heard the tale about being caught in a storm while paddle boarding. We walked up to UJ, the Hop and parted ways. I walked home, tried to put on The Color Purple, couldn’t compete with my neighbor mowing the lawn, and so wrote in my journal.

. . .

I watched that and some of Manhattan. I think I fell asleep pretty early.

V.XXVIII

I woke to a wren in one of my clementine boxes. I set off for downtown but noticed the coffee shop where Urban Orchard used to be had opened up, so I had two there, walked back to Ingles, met Lucy, hung at the house for a few, then drove to Tunnel Rd. for joann’s, Goodwill & Michaels.
   I dropped her off at her car, drove to OLR, talked to Cait on the phone, ate a burger, chatted with Grant, drove home and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I walked to the Brew Pump, stopped by Cait’s, walked down to Middlemont, set up my drums, hung in the hammocks w/ Ry, moved the drums to the porch and had rehearsal with he and Hannah.
   I rode with her up to Ingles, bought Cheez-Its, carried her TP and walked home, where I finished the box, ate a few grapes and fell asleep.

V.XXIX

I woke a few minutes before my 9:00 alarm, played Wordle, looked at Instagram, laid in my cocoon and eventually made a cup of coffee after packing up my rug and fancy blue shirt. I also wrote in my journal.

. . .

at noon, I drove down to Cait’s house. We set off for Bent Creek, but I was stricken with the idea of checking out Ross Farm. Cait agreed with the idea, so I turned this car around.
   The farm was truly amazing, several greenhouses full of all kinds of plants and even a couple ponds with ducks. I forgot to mention how we had first gone to Izzy's.
   We dropped off our plants — I had bought a fern, — and drove to Mamacita's. We went to Sow True Seed and ACE Hardware after that, rearranged her patio furniture and parted ways.
   I drove to Ryan's house, where we met up with Tina, packed her car and drove to the Statesville jail. We loaded in, sound checked, walk to the trude fuck (pizza) played a very exposed set, ate way too many snacks, packed up and drove back to Asheville while listening to Tina's first album (her as a child singing into a tape recorder.)
   I moved the drums back to the Mini and sped home.

V.XXX

I woke, walked downtown, got a coffee from High-Five, walked to Bold Rock, got a burger w/ Maddy, went to Books + News, bought a zine about Home Alone, went to the other High-Five, hung in Maddy's front yard, walked back downtown to her work and started heading back west.
   I texted Hannah when I was near the Greagle to see what she was up to, and we quickly made plans to hang out in RAD while she roller bladed. I got an Athletic from Wedge, jumped the fence by the hotels, met her by the dock. We went up and down the greenway, swung by her house for her laptop, went to Whale for a couple NAs + fries while she did some work for LaZoom.
   We hugged by her car at DeSoto. She drove to Taco Billy and I walked home. Alyse asked me if I could let out Charlie the Dog, so I started walking down there and found a 13” TV/VCR on Olney.
   I ran home, grabbed the car, picked up the tv, drove to Hendrix, let out Charlie, took Cait a donut, grabbed my fern, drove home and watched the remainder of Manhattan on my new tv.

V.XXXI

I woke and calibrated my new universal remote between Trains of Canada on the Panasonic and Top Dog on the JVC. Hannah asked if I could wait for a PA delivery at her house, so I started walking that way. She said I didn't need to be there til 1130, so I headed to Kota Kai.
   The PA was delivered before she left, so I walked to Aldi for grapes/bananas, went to Orbit, bought a Rugrats tape, went home, drove to Habitat Restore, bought two more tapes + a wooden box.
   I drove home, made peas + noodles, watched an episode of Rugrats, took a bath, watched another and started walking to Middlemont. Someone hollered at me from UJ; Hannah was outside eating with her sister and two friends. We chatted. I walked to rehearsal with Ryan, Melissa, Dulci, Sarah.
   Hannah arrived, tended to Max, put him to sleep and walked the dogs. She gave me a ride to Brew Pump, where I correctly guessed Maddy was waiting. We chatted with JB & Grant, walked home, watched Fern Gully ate noodles and fell asleep.

VI.I

woke at 630, drove Maddy to the airport, went home for a minute, drove to Hannah’s, packed her car, got lattes from Starbucks, drove to Statesville where she hosted a round of songwriters w/ Dulci, Laura and Karla Causey. Dulci’s parents showed up to surprise.
   We walked around the park, got food truck coffee, watched a bit of Isaac Hickerson, drove to Chipotle, ate, drove to Elkin, walked around the Trail Days festival, put our gear on the stage, set up, sound checked, played to no one, ate Mexican food and drove home while she DJed.
   We unloaded the car, hugged sweetly, parted ways. I went straight to bed and dreamed of hanging in-and-outside of churches with PJ, John & Paul.

VI.II

woke at 9ish and watched Trials of Life while drinking three coffees and writing in my journal. . .I watched The Point while posting to IG about Vibes in the Valley and eating my leftover burrito. I also ordered the Fox dub of Totoro from Ebay for $21 w/ shipping and started cooking some noodles.

. . .

I drove to the shed where we worked on the Orange Peel set, which ended up being Mountain Lion, Say Man wrapped inside O’ Constellation followed by the cool bridge with a spoken word story over it, The Humble Passenger.
   I went home and fell asleep without even turning on the light.

VI.III

I woke early, walked downtown thinking about what a liar I was. I got two coffees from High-Five and drank them in the park. I walked home, printed set lists, went to the market, ate a breakfast burrito under the tree and walked down to Kev's.
   We had rehearsal with him, Evan and Hannah. She and I got burgers from OLR. She worked on her computer while I drank two NA Guinness. We parted ways after that and I looked at my phone until I fell asleep.

VI.IV

woke at 9 and went to Kota Kai. Hannah met me there and we walked to Ingles, Battle Cat, Taco Billy, Harvest and the Bottle Shop, hanging flyers along the way.
   I drank my fruited NA sour in front of a church, posted to Instagram, went to Aldi for fruit and walked home just in time to not get rained on, all the while thinking about World of Warcraft. I took a nap, ate some grapes and struggled to decide what to do next, so I wrote in my journal.

The biggest deterrent from playing is the $15, but I’ll probably spend it on food otherwise. I guess I’m hoping someone will reach out to me. I don’t really feel like eating alone. A walk seems nice as usual, but nothing has fully motivated me.
   Noodles, weed and grinding in a tunnel seem like a fun option, very fun, but doing nothing and fasting might be the better move. I think there are feelings creeping in I should sit with.

. . .

I eventually did set up my laptop, renew my WoW subscription and take one lap through the tunnel on my warrior. I signed off, laid on the bed. This was after I had made some food.
   When it started getting dark, I watched Vanilla Sky. I texted Hannah to ask how her head was doing. We had small conversation, and, eventually, at midnight, she thanked me for checking on her and asked if I was alright too. I spent 40 minutes in bed thinking of the perfect response. I didn’t want to make her deal with my loneliness, but didn’t want to seem like I wasn't thinking about her.
   I said, “Yes. I’m glad we can look out for each other.”

VI.V

I woke around 9, procrastinated on responding to Taylor Watkins. After I responded to a group thread about practice, Hannah liked my message. Erica left at 10 and I made a cup of coffee, wrote in my journal. I’m feeling very lonely indeed.

. . .

I dealt with more seemingly urgent scheduling conflicts and drove down to Middlemont for rehearsal with Ryan, Melissa, Hannah & Max. We sat around and drank coffee for a bit afterwards, then parted ways.
   Hannah knew I was feeling weird because she immediately texted asking if she had done something to make things weird.
   I said I had been feeling lonely and sad the last couple days.
   She said, “I’m sorry :(“ and started sending lots of reels. I made some plain noodles and started to feel better. I said, “Noodles and reels helped. I know everything I have is enough and I never want to make my insecurities your problem.”
   Frustratingly, she said, “Okay”
   I drove to the shed where we had a fun run-through and started packing up. It occurred to me that maybe I had been an asshole. It didn’t seem likely since she had been sending me memes, but I texted saying, “Wait, I hope I didn’t do something rude or hurtful.”
   She said, “You didn’t! I am stressed today too and I am not managing it well
   You have been nothing but amazing”
   I said, “Okay you too”
   We drove to the Orange Peel, loaded in and started sound checking. Hannah texted me saying she had been cut from work, so I put her on the list. We met on the sidewalk, walked to Mamacita's, returned to the sidewalk and ate messily. Alyse walked up, so they went around to the front and me down to the basement. We played a very fun and improvisational set. I hugged Hannah afterwards and said hey to Ryan as well.
   I realized my rug and throne had gone into the van, so I found Scott and walked with him like four blocks to my car. I took a moment to appreciate how wonderfully surreal that is.
   We waited around for pizza that never came and, once the show was over, parted ways. I fell asleep and dreamt of hanging with reckless girls.

VI.VI

today marks the release of the Cheez-It Crunchwrap. I woke, drank a coffee, texted Hannah saying to holler if she wanted a walky, went back to bed, loaded drums into my car, ate a banana and wrote in my journal. . .At 1130, I drove down to the Greagle and loaded in my drums. I drove home, laid on the bed, looked at my phone, wrote in my journal and made a cup of coffee.

. . .

we played a fun show at the Greagle after a thorough sound check with Ménage, Amanda and The Moon & You. I didn’t invite any friends and there was something nice about the lack of pressure to talk to anyone. I did wish Hannah was there, though, and felt a bit lonely about it.
   I drove home with the top down and went to sleep.
   This must have been the day that my VHS copy of Totoro arrived; I watched most of it.

VI.VII

I woke and made an upstairs espresso. Erica came up and needed me to move the car. I made a downstairs coffee after that and drove to the shed where we worked on What About Now, Ace in the Hole, Say Man, Lucy and All My Friends.
   We talked about Clay and loitered for a while. I drove to UJ, ordered food for Hannah & myself, ate a little bit at Weirdo Central so as not to be early, went to Hannah’s, ate more, loaded her car and drove to Statesville. We pulled into town right behind Kevin, who decided to take a nap in his car.
   We found a coffee shop and both got caffeine + sweet treats, then went to the stage area, where we set up and checked sounds. Melissa was late due to a flat tire, and Fursty never showed, mainly bc he needed the help of AAA to put on the spare.    We ate weird “Asian” food and played a very good set to an enthusiastic crowd. The gang was very sad though because it sounds like her difficulties with Ryan are rather serious.
   We packed up the cars and drove home. Hannah and I talked the whole way about therapy, addiction, generational trauma, The Bee Hunter, stopping at two different TIngles for grapes, hop water, bananas, Cheez-Its, etc. She told me with that tremble in her voice that I had made her day so much easier. I told her that she had made mine more fun. She said she had never been accused of being fun before, and I said she allows everyone in the room to feel okay about not embarrassing themselves, which she agreed with, which I pointed out increases the overall level of fun.
   We also told the other we thought they were brave.

VI.VIII

I woke, drank two coffees in the hammock, took a filthy bath, trimmed my face and flossed. I watched some more Totoro and drove to Pisgah, filling the gas tank nearby. I arrived right behind Scott and started setting up the stage. Sound check was long and curmudgeonly.
   Scott watched baby Wes while the honeycutters checked. Then Hannah arrived and we had more of a rehearsal than a check.
   I ate a million sandwiches and drank a thousand hop waters, said hello to some of Hannah’s friends, played a pretty good set with her, Evan & Kevin, then hung w/ Gary and Fox. I helped Hannah w/ wes, including sweetly checking her hair for a bug.
   We played an action-packed Ever-Expanding set with Scott, but I wondered the whole time if my playing sounded insecure or eratic.
   The clips I saw do not indicate that. For an encore, we jammed on “If you can’t stand it, sit down,” Say Man and Mountain Dew.
   The post-set pizza was lovely, as was the company and weather all day long. I am truly blessed and tried to keep that in mind. I drove home and went to sleep without turning any lights on.

VI.IX

woke feeling depressed, lonely. I wanted to reach out to Hannah for a walk/hang, but felt like it was coming from a place of fear. I finished Totoro while charging my phone, cleaned my bed & bath and walked to Kota Kai, but they were closed, so I went to Izzy's, got a cup of dark roast, sat on the porch and wrote in my journal.

I feel better after writing so much. I fear that nothing has changed as far as Hannah’s feelings for me despite feeling closer than ever over two long and meaningful days together.
   I suspect she is working, but her briefness of correspondence last night and lack of reels today makes me feel like she knows what I feel; or perhaps it is just her cycle of feeling tired and reclusive due to fear of closeness.
   I walked to Odd’s and got a latte. It’s possible that the sad reality I don’t want to admit is simply her not thinking about me nearly as much as I think about her, which is something I am presently putting Maddy through.

. . .

I walked home, finished totoro and walked won to Hendrix, where we filmed performances of Take it Easy, More Than You Can Takeand Out of My Head. We talked about rehearsing afterweards, but decided against it. I drove to the Pump and listened to Tawny + Drew, then Allen + Alisha rabble on.
   I went home and tried to watch Autumn in New York, but something about it was just not good. I fell asleep puttering on my phone.

VI.X

I woke and went to a bsides photo shoot at silverball. Juan got me a sandwich, which I ate as we were wrapping up. I swung by YZ Market for noodles and Aldi for grapes, then took a little nap.
   I eventually walked up to Kota Kai, where I drank a coffee, received a text from Cait about a lunch hike and wrote in my journal.

. . .

I walked home, drove my car to Cait’s. We planned ongoing to Haywood Commons but switched to Botiwalla. We drove up townmountain with the top down, had a nice hike, went back to the west side, got coffees at Battle Cat, swung by the Brew Pump for cigs and a very brief hang and then went back to her house so we could gather her belongings and give me some mushrooms.
   I went to blueridge Ave after that for a little rehearsal with Scott & joecarroll. It was wild. I drove home, texted with Hannah and fell asleep.

VI.XI

I woke and left the house at 10:13. I drank two coffees in the park and walked to RAD Brewing, where I had an NA from brooklyn Brewing. I went to Ingles for a bag of pretzel crisps and ate them in bed, taking a short nap.
   At 5:40, I went to theodd, ate a cheesesteak and walked down to Hendrix. We had a photoshoot and rehearsal with Hannah, then she and I drove to her house and took a walk. I stopped by the Country Club on my way home and slept soundly.

VI.XII

I drank coffee in the hammock until Cait texted me, hinting that she needed a ride to her car. I drove her to oneworld, then took myself to Kota Kai and Orbit, where I bought The Big Hit & Romeo Must Die.
   I went home and watched most of Romeo, then went to Country Club for a beer w/ Jessee. I walked straight to Mamacita's, had a sit in the park, drank a latte outside of AVL Club, ran into Wyndham busking, then Ryan outside of the civic center.
   We waited for Melissa, then watched a great Khruangbin set. I loitered around after, seeing who I saw (Sarah, Juan, Josh, Wende, Aaron, Beau, Jacob, Logan, Hilary, Abby, Emily and others.)
   I went to doublecrown, said hi to Pruett, Phil, Scott, then walked to Country Club, then the Pub! I listened to Loomis talk about squirrels and had an awkward hello w/ Eden plus a usual interaction w/ Holly. I went home & fell asleep.

VI.XIII

I slept late, drove to libertyhouse, drank a coffee, met Maddy, walked to alldaydarling, had a big breakfast, walked back to my car, drove home, finished Romeo Must Die, got dressed and drove to Saluda. 
   Charlx was already there. I set up my gear, ordered an athlec, sound checked, ate pizza in the greenroom, played a great set w/ Dulci, packed up, drove home with the top down and fell asleep.

VI.XIV

I woke at 930, drank a coffee in the hammock, took a bath, discovered artlown, walked to koakai, ordered an iced latte and wrote in my journal. The pen I had purchased with this journal died.

. . .

I went to Aldi, then Izzy's. I went home, watched the end of Austin Powers, got dressed, made a battle plan, went to UJ, took food to Hannah, packed the car, drove to brevard, set up, played a few songs, got rained out, drove to a party, went back to Hannah’s, unloaded and parted ways. I stayed up all night.
