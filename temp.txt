We drove to Lucy in the Rye, ate. I sat on the corner with Myrtle while Hannah checked out the local outfitter. I drove us to Hannah's house, shuffled some things around, went to check on Merlin and Ophelia, then to Hillcrest.
   I dropped off Myrtle, drove to Leo's House of Thirst, sat with Alyse/Melissa Stutts. We watched Steve, Evan, Kevin, Jacob play music, were joined by Hannah, Clay, Becca, David Wimbesh, Jay Moyle, plenty others. I walked Hannah to her car, rode to Aldi, walked around with her, kissed goodbye, got in my car, drove to Hillcrest. I stayed up til 1:30 doing Shortcut case design, eventually realizing there was nothing connecting the two halves.

I woke, made six cups of coffee, came up with a janky solution to the Shortcut case, designed a cooler keyboard, ate, did the whole PCB, lost track of time. It was after eight when I called Hannah, drove to Ingles, bought hop water, continued to Downing, ate mac n' cheese + hot dogs, watched pottery, drove back to Hillcrest, redid the CN-634 PCB over and over again. I tried to sleep at 4AM, but didn't really do very much.

VII.XXIX

I woke around 9:30 after rocket ship dreams, did some 2D case mockup, struggled with Wordle (OMEGA in three.)[1253]
